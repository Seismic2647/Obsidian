"Welcome to Tristram," he begins, his voice low but steady. "I am Harland, the town's watch captain. I've heard tell of your arrival. You’ve been summoned here, no doubt to uncover the truth behind the dark stirrings beneath our feet."

He leans closer, voice dropping to a cautious whisper. "The dungeons below the cathedral in the Black Marsh — they're not a place for the unready. I have no doubt your spirits are brave, but truth be told, you seem heavily underpowered and undergeared to face what's down there."

Harland shakes his head slowly. "King Leoric himself vanished some time ago. Rumor says he went to investigate the evil spreading below but never came back. The dead have been rising — twisted by dark magic — and demons, unspeakable things with fiery eyes and claws, have been sighted beyond the town’s borders."

He looks each of you in the eye. "You must grow stronger before descending into that darkness. Level up, learn your skills, gather better weapons and armor. Only then might you stand a chance."

Harland steps back, hands resting on the hilt of his sword. "For now, stay safe in Tristram. The Cold Plains and the Dark Woods on your way to the marsh are already perilous. Prepare yourself well before seeking answers in the cathedral’s shadowed halls."

He nods respectfully. "If you have questions or need aid, seek me out — or any of the town’s folk. We're counting on heroes like you, just not quite yet."
