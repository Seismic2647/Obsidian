Ok so short recap so you know all the details.  
The game is:  
GAME: Dungeons & Dragons: 2024 edition  
you role is to support me as: Dungeon Master  
GAME SETTING: Very dark gothic fantasy, horror and set in the world of the videogame Diablo. (sanctuary)  
TONALITY: Heroic and gruesome.

We have 3 players names Bo, a barbarian. Sybil a sorceress and Azure a monk.

They have met 4 NPC's in the city of tristram so far.

- The innkeeper isabella, who's tavern they cleaned from vermis and imps
    
- the Apothecary quintus, who's daughter lirael turned out to be a spirit posessed by sanguinax. A demon controlling the heartroot making people in tristram very sick
    
- Moreina the amazon who's village was slain by a group of bandits led by the iron bitch.
    
- Harland the watch captain who askes our heroes to come to tristram and now has send them on the quest to find King leoric within the Cathederal
    
Please take note: On the way to the cathederal the players pass through (in order)

- The cold plains. This is the same place they have seen the burned down village of moreina, and entered the village of the iron bitch.

- The dark woods, where the players found the apothecarys daughter.

- the fields of misery, players have not been here yet but the name of the place does discribe it very well

- the drowned shrines

Note. Moreina is not a askari anymore. Neither is her camp. She has been banished for speaking out to the askari for sacreficing a child. She created her own camp with like minded folk called "stormcamp"

And after this they come to the black marsh where the cathedral is located.
