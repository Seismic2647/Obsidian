The story so far in bulletpoints;

The world we play in is called Sanctuary. Its based on the games of Diablo, where the world is also called sanctuary. Our DND game is set in the timeline of Diablo 1 where they have to find king leoric in the cathedral. At the end they will learn our king has gone mad and has been possessed by Diablo himself.


We have 3 players names Bo, a werewolf barbarian. Sybil a sorceress and Azura a monk. Use the classes to give the players more options and according to what their class should do.

Bo is a kind but loving soul, yet he can rage like a barbarian. He's kind of simple.
Sybil loves to investigate and use her magic to solve puzzles
Azura is a monk, acts likes the Avatar (aang, as in the cartoons) but at the same time has a dark side where she loves to pickpocket and steal things. She also loves to stab thing.  Azura has a cat called Eevee that she leaves in town, and a pet mouse called mimi that the takes with her on the road.

They have met 4 NPC's in the city of tristram so far.

- The innkeeper isabella, who's tavern they cleaned from vermis and imps
    
- The Apothecary Quintus, who's daughter lirael turned out to be a spirit posessed by sanguinax. A demon controlling the heartroot making people in tristram very sick
    
- Moreina the amazon who's village was slain by a group of bandits led by the iron bitch.
    
- Harland the watch captain who askes our heroes to come to tristram and now has send them on the quest to find King leoric within the Cathederal
    



- Quest one:
  Our party has cleared out the inn from some imps. Isabella, the inkeeper of the ravens inn was very happy with our heroes and promissed them they can stay for free as long as shes alive. The only downpoint: The only food they have in the inn is Potatoes. Mashes, fried, and baked, but its just potatoes.

- Quest two:
  The players have met Moreina in tristram, she looked like she had been through hell. Bruised and beat up because her camp (called stormcamp) was raided by bandits. Moreina used to be a Askari Amazon/Warrior but isnt anymore. Neither is her camp. She has been banished for speaking out to the askari for sacrificing a child. She created her own camp with like minded folk called "stormcamp". Both her weapons (a spear and a bow) have been taken from her.
- The players can find the bow and spear in the bandit camp in the cold plains. They found the items in a treasure room where they had to exit through a cellar in the ground filled with poop.
- At the end of the cellar/dungeon they met an angel named Virella, who's an angel that ressurects the dead angels to put them back in sanctuary.

- Quest three:
  Our players have met the Apothecary names Quintus.He asks for help finding the heartroot. This herb can clean the water in the town.  His daugher Lirael had gone to find it but has since been missing. After a quick run through the dark woods they found the daughter. Dead. She was possed by a demon called Sanguinax who lied to her by telling he would cure the village with the heartroot but instead possed her.

- Quest 4:
  Our heroes met with Hardland the towns watch captain again and they can set out to finally go to the Cathederal in the black marsh. To get there they have to travel through (important and in this order

The cold plains. This is the same place they have seen the burned down village of moreina, and entered the village of the iron bitch.

The dark woods, where the players found the disseased apothecarys daughter. She was possed by a demon called Sanguinax who lied to her by telling he would cure the village with the heartroot but instead possed her.

The fields of misery, 

The drowned shrines

The Black Marsh, it is here where the entrance to the cathederal lies beneath.)

- In the cold plains they discover a crypt with a puzzle, they got a crown out of this 
- dark woods they have a encounter with the **The Wither-Keeper** (Kelreth - name still unknown untill purified.  can refer to himself as 'I don't remember my name, due to rot of the brain').
- At the end they clense a effigy, giving them access to the fields of missery. 
- they go to the sunken temple after, here they visit a chappel and a statue island
- Afterwards they leave the drowned shrines, fighting a troll on top of a bridge. Defeating the troll they can finally enter The Black marsh.
- After looting the troll they find a magical key that gives them a shortcut to the bridge and so to the black marsh.


Players are now in the black marsh:
"You’ve traversed the haunted hollows, survived the Fields of Misery, and now the mire begins to thin. The smell of brine and decay fades into the crisp scent of damp pine and charred earth. The road ahead rises and hardens underfoot — old cobblestone, partially sunken, leading into the **Black Marsh**."

This is where our story continues.
