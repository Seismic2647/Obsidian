### üåë THE BLACK MARSH ‚Äî TWILIGHT'S EDGE

The mist thickens like a shroud as you tread deeper into the ancient mire. The cobbled road disappears under pools of black water that shimmer with _violet veins_ ‚Äî as if something _alive_ pulses just below the surface.

The Watchtower ruin looms ahead, its top shattered, leaning like a drunkard. The green light seen earlier? It's _gone_. In its place: **a mirror**, full-length and ancient, propped unnaturally against a tree with **no reflection cast at all**.

You didn't see it there before. You _should've_. You feel it now, like **something is watching you through it**.

Up ahead, a figure stands just off the road. Cloaked in rags, face obscured, hands trembling. It's a _child‚Äôs voice_ that emerges:

> "Don‚Äôt look at it too long... or you‚Äôll see what you forgot."

They step back and vanish. No tracks. No scent.

### üëÅÔ∏è ENCOUNTER: "THE MIRROR THAT REMEMBERS"

The mirror is not an illusion ‚Äî it's **The Eidolon Glass**, a relic from the _Age of Temptations_, when angels warred with mortal sin. It‚Äôs **not cursed** in the traditional sense ‚Äî it‚Äôs _interrogative magic_. Looking too long makes it **show you truths you‚Äôve erased**, or pieces of yourself torn away.

But here‚Äôs the twist:  
It **shows something different to each of you** ‚Äî not just visions, but _choices you never made_. _Forks you forgot_. It whispers in your mind in your own voice, yet warped like it came through static water.

### üí° POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS

1. **Azure** feels the mirror pulse when she steps close. If she _lays a hand on it_, the mirror might reveal her _first theft_ ‚Äî the moment she chose shadow over light. But with that memory may come **a hidden monk technique**, long suppressed. Risk of psychic backlash. {1}
    
2. **Sybil**, whose mind is finely tuned to arcane threads, can try a _Ritual of Binding_. It may let her speak to the entity _inside_ the mirror ‚Äî or worse, **invite it out**. Knowledge of forgotten runes could grant her a new glyph-spell‚Ä¶ or allow the being to possess a reflection of her. {2}
    
3. **Bo**, being pure of heart but dim of thought, may not be affected by the mirror at all... _unless he rages_. In a rage, the Eidolon Glass might reflect a moment of _his worst violence_ ‚Äî and from the mirror might step **a perfect clone**, made of smoke and grief. {3}
    
4. The party could **attempt to bury or destroy the mirror**. But every time a weapon is raised to it, it shows the wielder someone they failed to save ‚Äî and the emotional weight causes disadvantage to the attack. Still doable‚Ä¶ with a high Will save. {4}
    
5. **(Ridiculous/brilliant option):** Azure has Mimi scurry behind the mirror while Bo "distracts" it by performing _an interpretive rage dance_. If Mimi reaches the base, she might chew through the latent sigil scrawled in Infernal runes ‚Äî possibly _banishing the memory trap_‚Ä¶ or _releasing something that's been sealed inside for centuries._ {5}

### üòà SECRET LORE (for the DM only, unless discovered):

**The Mirror is not cursed.** It is a _demon‚Äôs prison._ A fragment of **Althogran**, the Memory-Eater, was bound inside it by Tyrael's order long ago. It can only influence through self-reflection ‚Äî feeding on suppressed memories and _rewriting guilt_. If the mirror breaks, the fragment may be loosed... or a piece of one PC‚Äôs _identity_ may be lost permanently.

If the players _voluntarily remember something painful_ and succeed a DC 17 Wisdom save, they might earn a **Mirror-Blessing**:

- **+1 to Wisdom**,
    
- **Once per long rest: Re-roll a failed Insight or Perception check**
    
- _Their reflection will forever be slightly ‚Äúoff,‚Äù staring back just a second too long._
