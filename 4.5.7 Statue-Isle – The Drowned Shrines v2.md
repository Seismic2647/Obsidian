### üìç _Statue-Isle ‚Äì The Drowned Shrines_

The mist hangs low as your boat glides over still, dark waters, rippling with a slow cadence that reminds you of breathing ‚Äî the slow exhale of a drowned world. Before you lies a jagged islet, barely rising above the floodwaters. Its surface is uneven, made of cracked stone and half-submerged rock. Moss clings to the shattered pillars like mold on old bread, and everywhere is the stink of rot and mildew. In the center of the isle looms a **massive weather-worn statue**, its face eroded by time, its arms outstretched toward the sky in some forgotten benediction.

As your party steps ashore, you feel a gentle _thrum_ under your feet ‚Äî like a pulse echoing through the stone itself.

### The Statue

Closer inspection reveals that the statue represents **Eothain**, a long-forgotten saint of balance and memory. Carved runes line the hem of his stone robe, partially faded, but enough remain for Sybil to decipher with ease:

> _‚ÄúMemory forgotten is power lost. Give remembrance form, and the past shall guide you.‚Äù_

At the statue‚Äôs base lies a **shallow offering bowl**, but unlike the sinister blood-stained altars of the past, this one is filled with **crumbling pages**, soaked in salt and rain. The bowl glows faintly with residual arcane energy ‚Äî old magic, not evil, not holy. Neutral. Raw.

### Interaction

This shrine **responds to personal memory**, not blood. A player may choose to place **a personal item** or a written **memory (journal, poem, symbol, etc.)** into the bowl. If a player chooses to speak or write a meaningful memory aloud, it echoes strangely, _carried away by the wind_. The statue's eyes then emit a faint sapphire glow.

If the party contributes appropriately (no dark rituals or sacrifice needed), they are granted a **boon**:

- **Boon of Eothain ‚Äì Whisper of the Past**  
    _Each hero gains +1 to a single skill of their choice for the next 24 hours, as memories sharpen their instincts._

### If the Party Refuses or Dismisses the Site

If they ignore the shrine entirely or desecrate it (e.g., mocking, looting), the statue subtly crumbles. The isle becomes noticeably colder, and upon departing, a strange fog rises behind their boat... though nothing seems to follow ‚Äî yet.

### Optional Secret (DC 15 Arcana or History)

A successful check reveals that the shrine is one of **six known Memory Shrines** scattered across Sanctuary. Finding them all might awaken something ancient ‚Äî perhaps benevolent, perhaps not. Each shrine feeds into a **forgotten ley network**, long abandoned by both angels and demons.
