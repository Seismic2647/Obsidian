Sitting at a bonfire in Tristram. Cold wind moves through the trees. Moreina sits, her body bruised, one arm bound with linnen strips. Her long hair is tangled from travel, and her eyes—sharp, dark—do not miss a single movement. She seems incomplete.

When approached, she doesn't look up right away. She waits. She listens. Then finally—her voice, calm, low, weathered by many winters.

> **"Its good to see some folk that took action and helped out.. That's a surprise."**

_(A beat. Then her tone softens slightly, almost reluctantly.)_

> **"I guess owe you some words. Sit, if you’ve the stomach for stories that don’t end in glory."**

_(She shifts her weight, wincing slightly. Blood crusts at her side. She stares toward the horizon, the way someone might look for something they know isn’t coming back.)_

---

> **"I was born Askari. One of the South Sea tribes. We lived by the tides, hunted with silence, and made war like fire: quick, merciless, and gone before the smoke cleared."**  
> **"Our elders taught us that the bow was the soul’s voice. That the spear was how we spoke to the gods. And I—"**  
> _(She hesitates, jaw tightening.)_  
> **"I spoke too loudly."**

> **"I questioned the rite of shadows—the blood-hunt trial. I spared a child we were meant to kill to 'appease the spirits.' The elders called it mercy. I called it reason."**  
> **"They called it weakness."**

_(She lifts her gaze now, meeting theirs directly.)_

> **"So they took my name from the stones, and cast me out."**

---

> **"I wandered. Across ash and ice, jungle and dune. I saw Zakarum priests burning their own, saw demons wear human skin as masks, saw a man trade his wife for a pouch of silver and never look back."**  
> _(Her mouth curls slightly at that memory—mocking, bitter.)_  
> **"Eventually I found the Cold Plains. Harsh. Wild. Honest."**  
> **"I started again. Built something from nothing. I called it the Stormcamp. I gathered warriors—lost women, oath-breakers, exiles. We weren’t family, but we fought like we had something to prove. Because we did."**

_(Now her voice turns cold. A crack of pain beneath the surface.)_

> **"Then they came. Dogs in armor. Bandits. Mercenaries with no cause, just greed. They raided at night, set fire to our tents, slaughtered the youngest in their sleep."**  
> **"I killed seven before I was forced to run. I would’ve rather died... but I had to carry the name. And the shame."**

> **"They took everything. But worse, they took _them_—"**  
> _(She gestures to the empty leather strap slung over her back.)_  
> **"My bow. Named Windlash. Made from the ribs of a Storm Wyrm, strung with silk from the spiders of the Kurast depths. It sings when drawn. And my spear, _Ivory Fang_—blessed by a witch in Scosglen to never dull."**  
> **"Those weapons are my soul and voice. And without them, I am less than shadow."**

---

> _(She leans forward now, fierce, deadly serious.)_  
> **"You want coin? I have none. You want thanks? I don’t give it easily. But if you find my weapons—if you _avenge_ my fallen camp—I will give you something even more rare."**  
> **"A bond. The kind warriors trust. The kind that bleeds beside you."**  
> _(Her eyes burn now—alive with purpose again.)_  
> **"Bring back what was taken, and I will fight at your side. Until we both fall, or the world does."**

---

> **"Do we have a pact?"**
