A short distance off the main trail, half-sunken in a boggy furrow between collapsed fences, the party stumbles upon a **massive iron contraption** — a cage of twisted plowshares and rusted reaping hooks, woven together with barbed wire and thick twine made from **braided human hair**.

Inside the cage are **six desiccated corpses**, positioned as if frozen mid-scream. Their flesh has shriveled and fused to the metal in places, and long trails of blood—long since blackened—trickle from their mouths and eyes. On closer inspection, their jaws have been broken and pried open. Each one had a **single seed** forcibly shoved down their throat.

The ground around the cage is cracked and diseased. Mutant roots snake out from beneath the corpses, crawling into the soil. Nothing grows near it. Insects flee from it.

### 🌿 Investigation:

- **DC 12 Medicine or Nature Check**: The roots emerging from the cage are unnatural — not demonic, but twisted by necrotic influence. Whatever was “planted” here was not meant to grow.
    
- **DC 13 Arcana or Religion**: The device appears to be an execution method by a local cult or deranged farmer sect — they believed sacrificing “mouths that speak of famine” would stave off the hunger of the land.
    
- **DC 14 Perception**: One of the corpses clutches a **small wax-sealed note** that simply reads:
    

> _“It’s coming from the marsh now. The roots will not listen.”_  
> The wax seal bears a malformed sigil shaped like a thorn-wrapped eye.

### 🧤 Interaction:

If the party chooses to **destroy the cage**, they must do so carefully. The structure is volatile — the tension in the wires is tight, and hacking at it carelessly will cause a collapse.

- **DC 13 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools or Smith’s Tools)**: Remove it safely and recover salvageable iron and hooks (worth 15 gp or usable as makeshift weapons).
    
- **Failing the check** results in a backlash: flying shards deal **1d6 piercing damage** to each nearby party member.

### 🎁 Optional Reward:

Hidden beneath the cage is a **tiny sack of withered seedpods**, each one warm to the touch. If planted, one grows into a **whispering weed** in 24 hours — a cursed plant that mutters secrets in the voice of the nearest corpse.

- If used creatively, a character can **ask it one question per day**, and the weed gives an ominous riddle-like answer based on the memories of the soul used to nourish it. Using the weed too often (3+ times) causes **nightmares**.
