🌑 SIDE QUEST: The Statue-Island of the Drowned Shrines
“She weeps not for what was lost, but for what was never born.”
🌘 Location: The Statue-Island

As the adventurers press deeper into the Drowned Shrines, the swamp begins to shallow, then widen, until it becomes a bleak, still black lake — ringed by half-collapsed columns, choked vines, and broken docks of a forgotten time. In the middle of the lake, on a mossy isle of shattered brick and bone, stands a towering, eroded statue — a hooded woman, her face long since melted by time, one hand outstretched, the other clutching what looks like a heavy iron chain.

The water here is perfectly still, as if held in place by reverence or fear. No birds. No frogs. No wind. The silence is almost religious. And yet… beneath the lake’s surface, something shifts.
🌕 Getting There:

The players must find a way across the black lake. A broken rowboat rests on shore, mostly usable with some minor repairs (DC 10 Investigation to spot it, DC 12 Tinker's Tools or Improvised Tools to fix it). Alternatively, Azura or Bo may choose to wade across (Dexterity saving throws to avoid slipping into sinkholes or disturbing something sleeping below).
🌊 Upon Arrival:

The ground beneath the statue is stone, but partially submerged and slippery with algae. There are signs this was once a shrine, now overgrown and desecrated. Broken offerings — rings, child-sized sandals, dried mushrooms, and melted wax — litter the base.

At the statue’s feet is a stone bowl, filled with a thin layer of black water that never seems to dry.
🧠 Discovery & Investigation:

Arcana / Religion / History DCs (pick one per player):

    DC 10: This is a forgotten local goddess, once worshipped as a guardian of unborn souls and the keeper of silent fates.

    DC 13: The black water is no ordinary moisture — it’s a trace of Tears of Unbirth, a rare cursed material sometimes used in necromantic rituals.

    DC 15: The statue was intentionally defaced, likely by a cult or clerics of Zakarum trying to stamp out her influence.

💀 Optional Encounter (If Provoked):

If the players touch the chain, draw blood, or disturb the offerings, a spectral child emerges from the water — featureless, but crying silently, pointing at the statue.
They hear in their minds:

    “Unloved. Unnamed. Unborn.”

If ignored, it simply fades away.
If attacked or touched, it screams — shattering the silence — and causes the statue’s mouth to split open unnaturally, vomiting out a cloud of despair (DC 14 Wis Save or gain 1 level of exhaustion). Then silence returns.
🎁 Treasure (Optional):

Inside the statue’s base (behind loose stones):

    Wombglass Ring:

        Wondrous Item (Rare, Cursed)

        When worn, this silver ring filled with pale fluid grants advantage on death saving throws and lets the wearer cast Sanctuary once per long rest.

        Curse: At night, the wearer hears distant infant wailing and wakes up with 1 level of exhaustion unless they make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw.

    Bone Charm of the Wet Mother:

        Once per day, you may breathe underwater for 10 minutes and gain resistance to necrotic damage during that time.

        However, your reflection in water is always a drowned version of yourself.

🧭 Actions Available:

    {Sybil kneels before the bowl and drips blood into it, whispering a name of someone she’s lost.}

    {Bo tries to shatter the statue’s chain, believing it binds something dark.}

    {Azura meditates by the child’s offerings, attempting to sense the lingering soul’s emotions.}

    {The party carefully loots the hidden compartment, disturbing nothing else — but the silence feels heavier now.}

    {They set the shrine ablaze, purging it with fire and leaving the spirits to the ash.}
