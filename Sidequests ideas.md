## Sidequest 1: **The Withered Grove**

### Hook:

Travelling hunters report that a section of the bloody forest farther north has become strangely withered and silent—no blood sap, no wildlife, only dead, blackened trees.

### Objective:

Investigate the withered grove to find the cause. You discover an ancient corrupted totem buried beneath the soil, poisoning the land.

### Challenge:

- The totem is guarded by a **Blighted Treant** (use _Treant_ stats but add necrotic damage and a blood curse aura).
- Removing or cleansing the totem could partially restore the forest’s balance and grant a boon.

### Reward:

- The _Blessing of the Withered Grove_: Once per day, you can reroll a failed saving throw.
- Clues pointing to the origins of the blood curse and the demon Sanguinax.

## Sidequest 2: **The Bloodbound Scouts**

### Hook:

A small band of Tristram’s scouts entered the bloody forest to map a safer path but never returned. Their last messages mention strange whispers and “red chains.”

### Objective:

Find the scouts—some of them are barely alive, bound by spectral blood chains binding them to the forest.

### Challenge:

- Fend off or negotiate with **Bloodbound Wraiths** (use _Wraith_ stats with added necrotic sap attacks).
- Free the scouts by breaking the blood chains—a magical ward tied to the Heartroot or to Lirael’s pact.

### Reward:

- Grateful scouts can act as guides.
- Salvageable weapons or supplies.
- Lore about blood magic and its limits.

## Sidequest 3: **Lirael’s Last Apprentice**

### Hook:

An old hermit in Tristram claims to be the last apprentice of Lirael and seeks your help to recover her lost sanctum hidden within the deepest forest.

### Objective:

Escort the hermit to the sanctuary. The hermit is fragile but knowledgeable, able to identify rare herbs and blood curses.

### Challenge:

- Along the way, spirits test the hermit with visions and illusions.
- Defend against cultists of Sanguinax seeking to prevent the sanctum’s rediscovery.

### Reward:

- The hermit’s knowledge provides a permanent resistance against necrotic damage.
- Additional Heartroot or potions crafted in the sanctuary.

## Sidequest 4: **The Blood Run**

### Hook:

A mysterious messenger offers the party a dangerous mission to retrieve a vial of pure sap from a tree guarded by a blood elemental.

### Objective:

Retrieve the sap without destroying the ancient tree, which is critical to the forest’s delicate ecosystem but also a source of potent magic.

### Challenge:

- The blood elemental (homebrewed elemental with necrotic and life-drain abilities) defends the tree.
- Timed challenge: the sap loses potency quickly once collected.

### Reward:

- Magical reagents to enhance healing potions or empower blood-themed spells.
- Favor with a secretive druidic order.
