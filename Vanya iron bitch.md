### **Death Flavor**

When defeated, Vanya collapses to one knee, spits out a tooth, and snarls:

> “Heh... I told 'em you might come. Never said you’d leave.”

If searched, the players find:

- A **battle map** showing **the layout of the Howling Hollow** bandit camp
    
- One of Moreina’s **missing spearheads**, used as a dagger
    
- A **letter** in military shorthand with strange orders: “Hold the gate. Delay any approach. She is watching.”
