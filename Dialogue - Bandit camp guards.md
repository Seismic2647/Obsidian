> **Guard 1 (Derrik, gruff and gravel-voiced):**  
> "You ever seen what she did to that knight from the south? The one with the fancy silver crest? She tore his breastplate off while he was still breathin’. Next week? She’s wearin’ it as a damn shoulder guard. Bent it into shape with a rock and her teeth, I swear."

> **Guard 2 (Marn, a younger voice, nervous laugh):**  
> "That’s why they call her the _Iron Bitch_, yeah? Not just 'cause she hits like a forge hammer. It’s the armor—every piece’s a trophy. Each one torn off someone who begged her not to take it."

> **Derrik (snorts):**  
> "Not even that. You know what she did with the loot of the latest raid? She snapped some weapons in have and mounted them on her wrist. Then she _Clawed_ a man's face off with it. Said it was poetic." I'm happy the rest of the loot is safely in the treasure room If she has it her way all if it will be wasted on killing other with it. We'll never get rich that way!

> **Marn (half-whisper):**  
> "She says she can _hear 'em screaming_ when she fights in their gear. Like their souls’re trapped in the metal."

> **Derrik (grunting):**  
> "Yeah, well... I say she just likes the sound of bones breaking. Lucky us—we’re on _her_ side. For now."

> _(They both fall into silence for a few moments. The fire cracks. Wind howls across the broken timbers of the camp palisade.)_

> **Marn (quietly):**  
> "What d’you think she’ll do when there ain’t no more enemies to strip?"

> **Derrik (after a pause):**  
> "...Hope we never find out."
