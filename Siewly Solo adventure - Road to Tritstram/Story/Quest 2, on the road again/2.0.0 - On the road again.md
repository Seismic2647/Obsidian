**🌒 CURRENT LOCATION: Outskirts of Witherhamlet (abandoned village), Western Foothills, Mountains of Khanduras**

**🐾 NPCs Nearby: Eevee (her cat companion), Mimi the mouse**

Azure climbs from the **stone throat of the Goblin Well**, her hands slick with goblin bile and **her new weapon, Whisperfang**, humming faintly like a vengeful memory. The air up here is **crisp and thin**, stinging her lungs as she emerges into the half-light of morning. **Eevee** paces silently beside her, eyes narrowed, tail twitching — alert.

The **village behind her lies silent**, three buildings, one of them burned and twisted (the farmhouse, where **Isabella** once wore another girl’s face). **Shadows stretch long** from the crooked remains of the town's signs, the letters long worn away save for one rusted plate that simply says: _“Let her not see you.”_

A **crow caws from a distant dead tree**, but its head turns **all the way around**, owl-like, then twice more. It flies off toward the **northeastern trail** — the path that leads toward the **Witch-Haunt Ridge**, a jagged cliff path wrapped in fog and folklore. That’s the way to **Tristram**.

But the **mountains are watching**.

### 🌄 The Khanduras Mountain Pass

==Ze is nu terug in het dorpje. hier is één huis die nog dicht is, kan ze bij inbreken? Het idee is dat ze verdergaat met de quest, over de mountainpass naar tristram. Ze kan er ook voor kiezen de broken tower in te gaan, de rest buiten het dorp is een klim over een dunne pass. Indien ze alleen wil doorgaan en niet naar de tower wil dan doorlezen helemaal onderaan==

The narrow trail snakes like a scar across the mountain's skin. Cold winds blow uphill, carrying whispers in a language Azure doesn’t understand — yet **feels drawn toward**. Thorny briars choke the edges of the path, some of them pulsing softly. She sees the occasional **weathered post with dangling bones**, goblin skulls, wolf ribs… and once, a **child's sandal** tied with black string.

This is a place the sane avoid.

==Far ahead, a **broken tower**== juts from a snowy cliffside. Crows wheel above it, screaming. Faint torchlight flickers near its base. Tristram lies _beyond_ it, but the tower is not empty.

The wind changes. **Mimi squeaks once**, then burrows deep in Azure’s pouch. Eevee stops, growls, and arcs her back. Something — _someone_ — is nearby.

### What Azure Can Do:

1. ==**Investigate the broken tower ahead**==
   — approach cautiously. The light might mean safety… or cultists. Or worse, both. {1}
    
2. **Use airbending to ride a sudden gust** up a side slope, gaining elevation to scout the trail and possibly spot ambushes or secret paths. Could draw attention, though. {2}
    
3. **Call upon Whisperfang’s elemental spark** to sear a sigil into one of the bone-marked trailposts, possibly revealing a hidden message left by the Echo Beneath… or triggering a trap. {3}
    
4. ==**Break into the sealed house**==
   she left untouched in the hamlet — maybe she missed something. Perhaps a survivor… or the skinwalker again, wearing a new disguise. {4}
    
5. ==**Eat a handful of strange mountain berries** growing near the path==— black with gold veins. A ridiculous impulse, but hey, **Mimi sniffed them and didn’t die**, so… {5}

As Azure wipes goblin blood from her blade and stares down the mountain road, a strange vision flickers at the edge of her mind: **a masked figure watching her from atop a dead tree**, robes of shadow stitched with flame, whispering her name in a voice _only heard in dreams_.

Welcome to the Mountains of Khanduras. The climb to Tristram begins.

{What does Azure do next?}
