### 📍 **SCENE: The Broken Tower, Witch-Haunt Ridge**

As the player-character **Azure** enters the ruined meditation room inside the tower, she chooses to **taste the ash** in an attempt to understand the residual magic.

### 🌀 **DM NARRATION (You Can Read Aloud or Paraphrase)**

> The ash burns on your tongue, dry and bitter, like rust scraped off ancient bone.  
> For a moment your vision **tilts**, and you're **no longer alone in your mind**.  
> You're in the same room — but **years ago**, centuries maybe — seen through another’s eyes.  
> A figure stands before the pedestal: **a man with no skin**, glowing with inner fire, chanting in a lost tongue. Vines slither from the stone, wrapping around his body. He is smiling. Something massive stirs deep beneath the mountain.  
> He turns, and speaks a single word — almost lovingly:  
> **“Alvex.”**

When the vision ends, Azure **coughs smoke**, and **a glowing handprint** is now visible in the stone floor before her.

From above, **wet, barefoot steps** begin to descend.

### 🎭 PLAYER CHOICES (Present to Azure’s Player)

Offer the following **narrative options**, as guidance or inspiration. These are **not exclusive**, and the player may always propose their own course of action.

1. **Inspect the glowing handprint**
    
    > Could be a **trigger for a hidden mechanism**, a **magical imprint**, or a clue to a locked memory.
    
2. **Attempt to quietly ascend toward the source of the sound**
    
    > Stealth + Dexterity check to possibly gain advantage or hear more of the intruder’s activity before being seen.
    
3. **Use fire or airbending to disrupt the lingering ritual circle**
    
    > Could erase the summoning tether — or agitate something latent and angry.
    
4. **Retreat and mark the location for return later**
    
    > Avoids immediate confrontation; can be sealed with stonebending.
    
5. **Speak the name "Alvex" aloud**
    
    > Might summon a spectral presence, trigger a buried memory, or **bind Azure in a blood contract** without warning. Deliciously dangerous.

### 🧠 DM Notes / Secrets:

- **The skinned man** is known as **The Root-Priest** — a fanatic who offered his flesh to commune with **"That Which Grows Beneath."**
    
- The handprint is part of a **three-part seal** — one of three locations where the Echo Beneath **locked away** something called the _Seed of Alvex_.
    
- Saying _“Alvex”_ **three times in the presence of the handprint** begins a **dark pact** — granting power, but drawing the attention of **the Root-Priest**, who still exists in a half-alive form.
