> A thin crack splits across the stone wall. From within it, **roots slither out like worms**, wrapping around a **humanoid figure** ‚Äî pallid, **skinned**, and dripping sap-colored ichor. It does not walk ‚Äî it is **carried** by the vines, and its **eyeless face** turns toward Azure as if it _remembers her_. It opens a mouth filled with curling tendrils and **speaks her name backwards**.
