**🌒 CURRENT LOCATION: Meditation Room, Broken Tower, Witch-Haunt Ridge, Khanduras Mountains**  
**🌫 WEATHER: Snow now thick, visible through the arrow slits — the air howls like a dying throat**  
**🕙 TIME: Still morning — but in here, it could be midnight**  
**NPCs Present: Eevee (cat companion), Mimi (mouse), and… a memory, not yet dead**

---

Azura kneels in the center of the **ash-drenched room**, surrounded by extinguished candles and **faint carvings in the stone**, scoured half away by wind and claw. **Eevee sits by the doorway**, hackles raised, tail stiff as wire. Mimi curls tight in Azura’s pouch, trembling against her side.

There’s **a bowl of blackened herbs** on a half-shattered pedestal, and beneath it, runes burned into the stone like scars. Most would shy from it — **but Azura knows the elements**. Fire speaks in flavor, in sensation, in the memory of what it touched. She has tasted air made from lightning, drawn water from bone. She reaches down.

Her fingers gather a **pinch of the grey soot**, and — without hesitation — **she presses it to her tongue.**

### 🌫 ELEMENTAL VISION: "THE ROOT IN THE DARK"

It’s not a flavor, not really. It’s a memory.

>The ash burns on your tongue, dry and bitter, like rust scraped off ancient bone.  
   For a moment your vision **tilts**, and you're **no longer alone in your mind**.  
> You're in the same room — but **years ago**, centuries maybe — seen through another’s eyes.  
> A figure stands before the pedestal: **a man with no skin**, glowing with inner fire, chanting in a lost tongue. Vines slither from the stone, wrapping around his body. He is smiling. Something massive stirs deep beneath the mountain.  
> He turns, and speaks a single word — almost lovingly:  
> **“Alvex.”**

She coughs — hard — and smoke hisses from her mouth. **Mimi squeaks in alarm**, and Eevee leaps into her lap, claws digging lightly into her robe.

On the floor before her, where the ashes once lay — is now **a perfect imprint of a human hand**, glowing faintly **from beneath the stone**.

And faintly — somewhere in the collapsed upper floor — **footsteps**, slow, bare, and wet.

### 🎭 PLAYER CHOICES (Present to Azura’s Player)

Offer the following **narrative options**, as guidance or inspiration. These are **not exclusive**, and the player may always propose their own course of action.

1. **Inspect the glowing handprint**
    
    > Could be a **trigger for a hidden mechanism**, a **magical imprint**, or a clue to a locked memory.
    
2. **Attempt to quietly ascend toward the source of the sound**
    
    > Stealth + Dexterity check to possibly gain advantage or hear more of the intruder’s activity before being seen.
    
3. **Use fire or airbending to disrupt the lingering ritual circle**
    
    > Could erase the summoning tether — or agitate something latent and angry.
    
4. **Retreat and mark the location for return later**
    
    > Avoids immediate confrontation; can be sealed with stonebending.
    
5. **Speak the name "Alvex" aloud**
    
    > Might summon a spectral presence, trigger a buried memory, or **bind Azura in a blood contract** without warning. Deliciously dangerous.

### 🧠 DM Notes / Secrets:

- **The skinned man** is known as **The Root-Priest** — a fanatic who offered his flesh to commune with **"That Which Grows Beneath."**
    
- The handprint is part of a **three-part seal** — one of three locations where the Echo Beneath **locked away** something called the _Seed of Alvex_.
    
- Saying _“Alvex”_ **three times in the presence of the handprint** begins a **dark pact** — granting power, but drawing the attention of **the Root-Priest**, who still exists in a half-alive form.
