Perfect. Letâ€™s rewrite and structure this moment cleanly into a **narrative combat encounter**, respecting the mystery around Moreina and making this feel like a _chaotic, tragic spillover_ from the massacre at Stormcamp.

We'll build tension with the scent and smoke, then crash right into the **chase-and-rescue combat** with banditsâ€”low-tier but cinematic. Afterward, the refugees can either offer a few cryptic hints or flee in panic, continuing the tone of desperation and displacement.

## ðŸŒ„ REWRITTEN SCENE: _The Bleeding Sky_

**Location:** Outer Ridge of the Khanduras Pass  
**Time:** Twilight  
**Weather:** Winds carrying ash and iron  
**Environment:** Craggy slopes above the Cold Plains, cut by sharp ridges and sparse, wind-twisted trees.

### ðŸŽ­ Scene Setup

The pass narrows, flanked by jagged rockfaces. Below, the fading sun bathes the Cold Plains in a bloody orange glow.

**Smoke trails** rise on the horizon â€” thick and black. Azura smells **burnt leather, scorched meat, and copper blood**. The winds shift. A sound â€” metal clashing and hooves pounding earth â€” drifts up from the path ahead.

Just around the bend, she sees them:

- **Four bloodied figures**â€”two adults and two older childrenâ€”scrambling up the pass trail.
    
- Behind them: **Seven mounted bandits**, clad in spiked leathers and wielding rusted axes or hooked swords, riding mangy desert horses. Theyâ€™re laughing. Hunting.
    
- One bandit raises a **crossbow** toward the nearest child.
    

They havenâ€™t seen Azura yet.

### ðŸ§ƒ Optional Pre-Combat Choices:

1. **Ambush with elemental manipulation** â€“ Melt the ground beneath the banditsâ€™ mounts, hurl a burst of wind to unseat them, or split the trail with a stone spike.
    
2. **Run in fists blazing** â€“ Get surprise round if Azura sprints and attacks from cover.
    
3. **Use illusion/diversion** â€“ Disorient the bandits with flame illusions, thunderclaps, or a mimicry of more guards coming.
    
4. **Let them pass, then follow quietly** â€“ Risk the refugees being slain, but could discover something useful on their bodies or among the bandits.
