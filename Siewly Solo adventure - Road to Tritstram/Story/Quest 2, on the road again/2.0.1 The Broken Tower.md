### 🕯 The Broken Tower

The path narrows as Azura climbs higher, **rocks slipping beneath her boots**, and the **tower emerges from the fog** like a fractured bone jutting from the spine of the world. It’s **three stories tall**, but the top has caved in — a **spire of blackened stone and iron**, bent like an arthritic finger. What remains stands crooked, defiant, its arched doorway hanging open like a yawn that **doesn’t end**.

Around the base lie **abandoned belongings**: torn bedrolls, rusted tin cups, a child’s stuffed lamb stitched with glass beads, and a **ring of melted candles**, long cold. The door bears a **symbol: an inverted tree**, its roots writhing upward. Familiar now… another **mark of the Echo Beneath.**

Azura steps over a threshold of **scorched salt**, and the world behind her quiets.

The interior is narrow and winding — stairs climb **only partway before collapsing** into rubble. Still, there are three rooms intact: **a library (collapsed and buried in ash), a meditation room with flickering candles**, and a locked, rune-covered iron door behind a broken altar.

The air tastes like secrets.

### 🎲 Skill-Based Choices for Investigation:

1. **[DEX + Stealth] — Ghostlike Movements:**  
    Try to move through the tower **without making a sound**, allowing Azura to eavesdrop on whispers drifting down from the broken upper floors. **DC 13**
    

> _Success:_ Azura hears a ritual phrase: _“The Sleeper drinks the roots of men.”_  
> _Fail:_ A loose stone clatters — a voice from above stops whispering.

2. **[WIS + Insight] — Ritual Reading:**  
    Study the **candle formation** and the ashes in the meditation room to determine what kind of ritual was performed. **DC 14**
    

> _Success:_ This was not a prayer — it was a _binding_, or _summoning_. Something might still be here.  
> _Fail:_ Azura misinterprets — and accidentally **smudges** the remaining rune.

3. **[INT + Arcana] — Rune Door Deciphering:**  
    Attempt to read the **script on the sealed door**. The glyphs shimmer faintly. **DC 15**
    

> _Success:_ Azura discerns the phrase: _“To speak the true name of flame, breathe no air.”_ The door clicks softly… unlocked.  
> _Fail:_ A small **gout of black fire** flares out, searing her hand (1d4 fire dmg), and the runes **rearrange**.

4. **[CON + Survival] — Taste the Ashes (yes, literally):**  
    **A monk of elemental skill might attempt to sense the source of magic by tasting the air and soot. Weird, but potent. DC 12**
    

> **_Success:_ Azura gains a momentary vision of a man with no skin, standing in this tower whispering to a great vine stretching down into the mountain.**  
> **_Fail:_ Azura is nauseated, giving her disadvantage on her next skill roll.**

5. **[CHA + Deception] — Mock the Echo (dangerous):**  
    Azura could speak mockingly aloud to the Echo Beneath, baiting any spirits or cult presence into revealing themselves. **DC 14**
    

> _Success:_ A ghostly voice responds with a name: _“Alvex.”_  
> _Fail:_ A hidden eye **opens** behind the altar — **madness check may be required** if left ignored.
