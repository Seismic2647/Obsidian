### ðŸ”— **Whisperfang, Chain of the Hollow Flame**

_Weapon (kusarigama), uncommon (requires attunement by a monk or rogue)_

> Forged in the tunnels of a forgotten monastery swallowed by the earth, this kusarigama was once wielded by a flame-dancer turned assassin. The blade hums with faint heat, and its chain shudders with invisible tension, as if _hungry to coil around somethingâ€™s throat_. A small, almost unnoticeable glyph of the Echo Beneath is burned into the sickleâ€™s base.

### ðŸ©¸ _Special Properties_:

- **Flickering Reach:** When you make a melee attack with the chain end, it has **Reach (10 ft)**. You can use a bonus action to switch between the chain or the sickle ends.
    
- **Elemental Spark (1/day):** You may declare this before an attack roll. The weapon crackles with flame or frost (your choice). On hit, the target takes an extra **1d4 fire or cold damage**, and must succeed a **DC 12 Dex save** or have **disadvantage on their next attack** due to pain or numbing chill.
    
- **Coil & Trip:** Once per short rest, when you hit a creature with the chain, you can attempt to **trip** it. The target must succeed on a **DC 13 Strength saving throw** or fall **prone**.
    
- **Monk Compatible:** Counts as a monk weapon and can be used with **Martial Arts**, **Deflect Missiles**, and **Ki-Fueled Attack**.

### ðŸ•· Flaw:

**Whispering Hunger** â€” When you reduce a creature to 0 HP with this weapon, roll a d6. On a 1, you feel an _urge to strike again_. If you fail a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw**, you must spend your next bonus action attacking the nearest creature â€” even an ally â€” unless there are no creatures within range.
