 üåë THE BLACK MARSH ‚Äî "THE EIDOLON GLASS"

The mirror hums, almost indistinguishable from the pulse in your own veins. Its frame is wrought iron, curling into _taloned vines_ that seem to wriggle when not observed directly. Not a single speck of dirt mars its surface; even the air around it feels... **sterilized**.

The whispering begins again ‚Äî but now, it's not distant.  
It‚Äôs **your own voices**.

### üëÅÔ∏è The Mirror Reveals (Everyone Experiences Individually)

#### **Azure:**

The reflection is off. It shows _you_ standing still, but Mimi is climbing up your shoulder, eyes gleaming like obsidian beads. Your reflection grins ‚Äî a predatory, _hungry_ grin.

> "Remember the Vault, little shadow?  
> The Monk who shared everything.  
> Except the secrets you took."

A flash: A memory of a **temple vault**, an old master‚Äôs body lying cold. A key in your palm. Shame. Excitement. You _stole from the enlightened_, didn't you?  
What _did_ you steal?

The mirror asks. Demands.

---

#### **Sybil:**

Your reflection flickers ‚Äî hair shifts, face bruises, then smooths. Then you see **your mother** behind you in the glass ‚Äî only, she's _hollow-eyed_, her lips sewn shut with thread of ash.

> "Did you think your magic was yours?  
> Or did you _take_ it... like everything else."

The memory: A tomblike study. Forbidden books. The moment you said the wrong incantation, and **father started bleeding from his eyes**.  
You never asked him if it was your fault, did you?

The mirror wants to know the truth.

---

#### **Bo:**

Your reflection is...warm. Happy. Bo with a stew pot and potatoes. Bo smiling wide. Then ‚Äî it _stops smiling_. It tilts its head.

> "You don't want to remember what happened to pack, do you?  
> Easy to forget when your head is full of rage.  
> But you know why you were the last one, don‚Äôt you?"

You see a _forest fire_. Blood. Fur. Claws.  
And your own hands ‚Äî tearing out a throat.

The mirror murmurs: _"You let go too long. The beast made a choice."_

### ü©∏ The Trap Tightens

The mirror doesn‚Äôt just show ‚Äî it **asks**. It _pleads_.

> "Confess.  
> Remember.  
> Or lose it forever."

For a split second, you all hear _each other's whispers_. Flashes of the others‚Äô sins. **Nothing clear, just dread.**

And suddenly, Virella‚Äôs voice echoes faintly in a memory:

_"Shadows are patient. They feast when the heart is weakest."_

### üåï POSSIBLE ACTIONS (Psychological Stakes):

1. **Azure**: Relive the vault memory. _What was in that vault?_ You could choose to **accept it** and gain a shadowy boon (maybe a cursed relic resurfaces in her inventory). Or **deny it**, losing proficiency in Sleight of Hand _until she finds that vault again._ {1}
    
2. **Sybil**: Confront the moment with her father. Perform a _Minor Ritual of Blood_ (your own) and apologize into the mirror. Risk: Taking **2d6 psychic damage** but gaining **+1 Arcana** temporarily. Or walk away, knowing _the mirror may now watch you permanently._ {2}
    
3. **Bo**: Laugh at the mirror to defy it ‚Äî _‚ÄúBo too dumb to remember!‚Äù_ ‚Äî making a saving throw to shrug off psychic influence. If failed, the GM can describe a **small part of his humanity fading** (Bo struggles to recognize familiar faces for a while). {3}
    
4. **Group Action**: Link hands and each voluntarily **sacrifice a memory** (the DM will take something non-combat-important from their backstory). Do so, and the Eidolon Glass **implodes**, leaving behind a single **memory shard**‚Äî which may be used later to recall something _they were never supposed to know._ Dangerous knowledge could be acquired. {4}
    
5. **(Brilliant/Terrible)**: Someone _sticks their HEAD through the mirror_ to see what‚Äôs on the other side. Trust me‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs something on the other side. {5}

The marsh around you holds its breath. Even the distant croaks of frogs and buzzing insects seem muted. No enemies marching, no altar rising ‚Äî just _your own minds_, offered as the battlefield.

Do you tempt them to press on the wound, or pull back?
