Absolutely! Here are some encounter ideas for a “bloody forest” in the world of Sanctuary (Diablo-inspired), along with adventure hooks and **statblock suggestions** (stat blocks for D&D 2024 provided as you requested):

---

## Reason to Enter the Bloody Forest

**Hook:**  
You are summoned to the outskirts of Tristram, where desperate peasants beg for your help. Recently, travelers and even seasoned soldiers have gone missing in the dense woods east of town. Those who return speak of trees whose sap runs red as blood and whispering voices that lure the unwary. Worse, an ancient evil artifact—rumored to be the “Veinstone Heart”—may be hidden within.

## Encounter 1: Bloodsap Dryads

**Setup:**  
As you push through foliage sticky with crimson sap, you see eerie, pale women with bark-like skin and eyes like burning embers. They snarl, “The forest lives… the forest drinks,” and attack, desperate to protect their tainted grove.

**Statblock Suggestion:**

- **Bloodsap Dryad:**
    - Use _Dryad_ statblock (MM), but add a sap-themed touch:
        - **Blood Sap Touch.** Melee weapon attack that deals necrotic damage and reduces max HP until a short rest.
        - **Entangle.** Area entangle, but roots look sinewy and vein-like.
    - CR: Around 1–2 each for level 3 PCs.

## Encounter 2: The Flayed Stag

**Setup:**  
Suddenly, a stag with exposed musculature (no skin, only pulsing veins), eyes glowing red, crashes through the brush, pursued by invisible tormentors. It collapses, but then rises again—possessed by a restless, violent spirit.

**Statblock Suggestion:**

- **Possessed Flayed Stag:**
    - Use _Dire Wolf_ but add:
        - **Blood Frenzy.** Advantage on attack rolls against any creature that doesn't have all its hit points.
        - **Bleeding Aura.** If damaged, sprays blood within 5 ft, forcing a Con save or take ongoing necrotic damage.
    - CR: About 1 (adjust for party numbers).

---

## Encounter 3: Wailing Lost Souls

**Setup:**  
Mists blanket the ground. The screams and cries of lost souls echo through the woods. Wispy, bloody apparitions materialize and close in—lost victims of the woods, begging for release or vengeance.

**Statblock Suggestion:**

- **Bloody Wraiths:**
    - Use _Specter_ or _Will-o’-Wisp_ statblock with the following modification:
        - **Blood Drain.** Successful touch attack also heals the wraith.
        - **Incorporeal Movement.** As normal.
    - CR: 1–2 per wraith.

---

## Encounter 4: Cultists of the Sanguine Hand

**Setup:**  
A fire burns ahead—crazed cultists in red-tinged robes chanting over a bleeding altar, sacrificing goats and even one terrified villager, trying to summon a demon of blood. If not stopped, the ritual completes!

**Statblock Suggestion:**

- **Cult Fanatics (Sanguine Hand):**
    - Use _Cult Fanatic_ statblocks, but add:
        - **Blood Magic.** Can spend HP to add damage to spells.
        - **Summon Lesser Blood Demon** _(if ritual is completed):_  
            Use _Quasit_ or _Imp_ stats but with acid replaced by necrotic/blood theme.
    - Number as appropriate.
