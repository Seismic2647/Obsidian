Third goblin room

As the party approaches this room, pick a character at random and demand a Wisdom (Perception) check. If they get a 10 or higher, they hear voices arguing beyond the door in what sounds like [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb). Because it is [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb), and there are goblins in there.

If the characters open the door, drop this on them:

[–]

Two pissed-off goblins chatter in their native language. Between them is the dead body of a third goblin. All of them look alike, so maybe they're related? Something for your noodle to bake on for a while.

Behind them is a pile of glittering treasure. Wealth beyond reckoning! It could be yours! Just deal with these goblins first, and remember: these are someone's mommy and daddy, maybe.

All three of these little monsters (living and dead) have armor and weapons. Once they notice the characters, they drag them into the argument too. The two [goblins](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#goblin_mm) speak only a little [Common](https://5e.tools/languages.html#common_phb), so their speech is mostly [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb) chittering with [Common](https://5e.tools/languages.html#common_phb) words sprinkled in: "murder," "treasure," "a-hole," that kind of thing. Anyone who speaks [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb) understands that the two goblins are accusing each other of murdering the third. Classic.

### Investigation Optionp9[–]

So your players are a bunch of spongy-spined Jerrys who want to play fantasy Sherlock Holmes instead of attacking? Fine. Let them try to interrogate the goblins and inspect the body. The goblins just chatter away angrily and blame each other for the murder. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character searching the body discovers coins scattered near its mouth. If they're gutsy enough to pry the dead gob's mouth open, they'll find it full of coins as well.

If these observations are pointed out to the living goblins, they both act shocked. A hearty and successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals they're full of s***. A successful DC 12 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check then pries a confession out of them.

The goblins switch immediately from being argumentative to being ashamed. In halting [Common](https://5e.tools/languages.html#common_phb), they admit that they dared their friend to swallow more coins than they did (around 100 gp for each of them). If the characters demand they cough up the gold, the goblins try to make themselves vomit. This creates all kinds of terrible noises, but those coins are happy right where they are: in the tum-tum.

If the characters still don't attack after all that, the goblins flee the room, left alive to pass on their successful genetics and create more coin-eating idiots.

### Murder Optionp9[–]

Much better! Who cares who killed the goblin? They're all little monsters, get rid of them! Jeez, I hate goblins. Every time you kill a goblin, somewhere out there, a Rick gets his wings. Nice work. If the gobs from [area 5](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#rmbre,1,5.%20another%20goblin%20room,0) are still breathing, they join in this mayhem after 1d4 rounds of combat.

As the bodies hit the floooor, they make a suspicious jingling sound.

### Treasurep9[–]

The dead goblin has 200 gp inside them. If killed, each of the other goblins holds 100 gp in their stomach.

All the rest of the glittering pile of treasure in the room turns out to be gold-wrapped chocolate coins, which are worth exactly squat but likely would have been less fatal in a coin-swallowing contest. They are poisonous to dogs, though, so don't mess around.
