As the adventurers approach this room, have everyone make a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. Anyone who succeeds can hear two [goblins](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#goblin_mm) talking in [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb) about how their friend Jerry is a useless jerk.


One of the goblins is wearing an eye patch. Her name is "Been." The other goblin has a bad leg, and his name is "Oog." If the characters are sneaky, they might be able to surprise these losers. Otherwise, if the party attacks, these gobbo-slobbos fight back. But before they both die, at least one flees to their pals in [area 5](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#rmbre,1,5.%20another%20goblin%20room,0).


> [!NOTE] Room
> This room features a small wooden table and a couple of stools. Two goblins hang out here, looking pretty bored. Maybe they'd be less bored if they got into a life-or-death struggle with a few adventurers? Just a thought.
