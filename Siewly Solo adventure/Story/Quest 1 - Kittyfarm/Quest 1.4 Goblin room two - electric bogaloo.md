> This big old circular room features six bedrolls on the floor, a bunch of dice, and some parchments scattered around. Oh yeah, and four goblins are here.


The four [goblins](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#goblin_mm) are named Jerry, Jeri, Gerry, and Gerie. Gerrie heeft alleen een lang wit shirt aan, zonder broekje. Zn goblin piemoltje zie je eronderuit hangen. If Leg or Eye from [area 2](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#rmbre,1,2.%20goblin%20room,0) fled here, all the goblins have grabbed their [scimitars](https://5e.tools/items.html#scimitar_phb) and set up an ambush—but around the entrance opposite the one the party comes through. If Leg or Eye didn't make it here, the characters catch the goblins even more off guard.

If the adventurers are naked (most likely because of the mouth in [area 4](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#rmbre,1,4.%20magic%20mouth%20room,0), but for any reason, really), the goblins have disadvantage on attack rolls in the first round of combat, as they giggle at the group's jiggly unmentionables.

### G&G Nerdsp8[–]

At first glance, it might look like the goblins were gambling. But a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to poke through the dice and parchments reveals that they were actually playing _Goblins & Gizzards_ (G&G), their favorite tabletop roleplaying game, written in [Goblin](https://5e.tools/languages.html#goblin_phb).

_Goblins & Gizzards_ is way better than D&D.

### Treasurep8[–]

The goblins carry 20 gp, 35 sp, and the key to the treasure room ([area 6](https://5e.tools/adventure.html#rmbre,1,6.%20treasure%20room,0)). Their gaming setup also features a really nice set of eleven greenish-yellow dice. Each die is worth 1 gp and comes with a lifetime of warm, murderous memories (adding no additional value). Any character who takes these dice has the strong urge to collect more. Many, many more.
