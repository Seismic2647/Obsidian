**🌒 CURRENT LOCATION: Meditation Room, Broken Tower, Witch-Haunt Ridge, Khanduras Mountains**  
**🌫 WEATHER: Snow now thick, visible through the arrow slits — the air howls like a dying throat**  
**🕙 TIME: Still morning — but in here, it could be midnight**  
**NPCs Present: Eevee (cat companion), Mimi (mouse), and… a memory, not yet dead**

Azure kneels in the center of the **ash-drenched room**, surrounded by extinguished candles and **faint carvings in the stone**, scoured half away by wind and claw. **Eevee sits by the doorway**, hackles raised, tail stiff as wire. Mimi curls tight in Azure’s pouch, trembling against her side.

There’s **a bowl of blackened herbs** on a half-shattered pedestal, and beneath it, runes burned into the stone like scars. Most would shy from it — **but Azure knows the elements**. Fire speaks in flavor, in sensation, in the memory of what it touched. She has tasted air made from lightning, drawn water from bone. She reaches down.

Her fingers gather a **pinch of the grey soot**, and — without hesitation — **she presses it to her tongue.**

### 🌫 ELEMENTAL VISION: "THE ROOT IN THE DARK"

It’s not a flavor, not really. It’s a memory.

Suddenly she’s **not herself.** Her body is in the room, yes, but her senses tilt — pulled back, into **another mind**, another skin.

The taste fills her mouth with heat, **metal and copper**, and her vision burns white, then bleeds black as the mountain opens below her. She stands in this very room — but in the past.

The **figure has no skin**. A man, maybe once — his eyes glow like submerged coals. He stands over the same pedestal, murmuring in **a language half-sung, half-choked**, his hands outstretched. Vines **slither from the cracks in the floor**, pale and pulsing like veins. They wrap around his legs, his arms — but he smiles.

Beneath him, something stirs.

A **presence below the tower**, vast, coiled, breathing so slowly it may not have been alive. Something ancient. Something hungry.  
A whisper coils around Azure’s spine, _“The seed must drink the heart to bear fruit.”_

The skinned figure turns suddenly — not at her — but at **something behind her**, in his time. He speaks a name:

> **“Alvex.”**

### 💀 Azure snaps back.

She coughs — hard — and smoke hisses from her mouth. **Mimi squeaks in alarm**, and Eevee leaps into her lap, claws digging lightly into her robe.

On the floor before her, where the ashes once lay — is now **a perfect imprint of a human hand**, glowing faintly **from beneath the stone**.

And faintly — somewhere in the collapsed upper floor — **footsteps**, slow, bare, and wet.

---

### What Azure Can Do Now:

1. **Examine the glowing handprint** — perhaps an elemental key or something tied to Whisperfang. {1}
    
2. **Head silently toward the upper floor**, trying to sneak up on whatever the hell is up there now. {2}
    
3. **Use firebending to “cleanse” the ritual circle**, possibly severing a tie to the Echo Beneath — though the backlash could be violent. {3}
    
4. **Retreat and seal the tower behind her** using earthbending — perhaps the knowledge is enough… for now. {4}
    
5. **Call out the name “Alvex” aloud**, daring the entity to answer. Dangerous. Bold. So very Azure. {5}
    

What will she do?
