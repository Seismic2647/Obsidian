## 🐭 The Mimi Arc: “Roots Beneath the Fur”

### 🖤 Overview

Mimi — Azure’s loyal pet mouse — unknowingly absorbed a fragment of the Root-Priest’s lingering essence during the fight at the Broken Tower. This fragment **buried itself deep** inside her tiny frame, **dormant at first**, but growing as they travel through the root-soaked lands of Khanduras.

She is now a **conduit** for ancient, fungal consciousness — and the perfect seedbed for **Alvex’s whispering will**.

## 🪰 Arc Timeline: Corruption Stages

These events unfold naturally over sessions as Azure journeys onward. You can space them by milestones or long rests.

---

### 🌱 STAGE 1 — “Patterns in the Dust” (Immediate)

- Mimi scratches strange **spirals into the dirt** when Azure sleeps.
    
- Eevee hisses at her once and refuses to share Azure’s pouch.
    
- At night, Azure _hears whispering_, but cannot understand it. If she **casts Detect Thoughts** near Mimi, she hears a **repeating, childlike voice**:
    
    > “I miss the soil... I miss the root... I miss the fire...”
    

_No mechanical changes yet._

---

### 🌿 STAGE 2 — “Eyes in the Green” (After 2–3 major encounters)

- Mimi’s eyes begin to glow faint **phosphorescent green** in the dark.
    
- She now **automatically detects nearby plant creatures** within 30 ft.
    
- When Azure uses elemental magic near Mimi, **roots twitch toward the source**.
    

_Azure must make a DC 13 WIS save when sleeping within 10 feet of Mimi or suffer unsettling dreams, gaining no benefit from long rest unless passed._

---

### 🌳 STAGE 3 — “She Speaks in Roots” (Mid-arc, after 1–2 more sessions)

- Mimi begins to **speak** — softly, haltingly, in Whisper-tongue (understood only by Azure due to exposure).  
    Phrases include:
    
    > “The Seed remembers you.”  
    > “The girl in your blood smiles.”  
    > “Alvex grows in your shadow.”
    
- Mimi can now **cast Entangle once per long rest**, centered on herself.
    
- She begins to **resist separation** from Azure, becoming anxious or violent when left behind.
    

---

### 🌑 STAGE 4 — “Blooming Hunger” (Climax of the arc)

Mimi dies… but doesn’t.  
Her body **blooms with white roots**, twisting into a strange skeletal creature — a **mouse-shaped root-golem** that floats slightly above the ground, her fur now moss and vine.

This transformation can be **delayed**, **hastened**, or **embraced** by Azure depending on her choices.

---

## 🌫️ Mimi the Root-Warden (Transformed Form) — Statblock

**Tiny Elemental/Plant, Neutral (bonded to Azure)**

> This is not a combat pet. It’s a **roleplay-focused creature** with narrative influence.

---

**Armor Class:** 15 (natural root armor)  
**Hit Points:** 1 (but cannot be killed by physical damage; reforms over 24 hours unless purged)  
**Speed:** 30 ft. hover

---

**Abilities:**

- **Plant Empathy.** Detects emotions of plant/fungus creatures within 60 ft.
    
- **Root Flare.** Once per long rest, can cast _Faerie Fire_ (DEX DC 13).
    
- **Sporemind Channel.** Azure can use Mimi as a **focus** for spells requiring verbal components, even while silenced.
    
- **Alvex Fragment.** If Mimi is destroyed, Azure must make a **DC 15 CHA save** or be briefly possessed by the Root-Priest’s whispering voice — gaining **advantage on Insight**, but **disadvantage on Wisdom saves** for 1 hour.

## 🧩 Moral & Narrative Dilemmas for Azure

You now have several great moments to tempt or torment Azure’s player:

---

### 🔥 Do you burn Mimi?

- A strange druid in the mountains warns that the creature inside her is **“older than Sanctuary, and ten times more patient.”**
    
- A ritual can **burn the Root**, purifying her — but Azure must choose whether to **risk losing Mimi forever** or **keep the only familiar thing in a world that keeps getting darker.**
    

---

### 🕯️ Do you join her to Alvex?

- Azure may be able to **complete Mimi’s transformation**, creating a permanent companion bound to the Sporemind.
    
- This can come with **mechanical benefits**, like plant-based abilities, shared dreams, or influence over fungal/rot monsters.
    
- But it may also **mark Azure** — both magically and politically — as a servant of the Root.
    

---

### ✨ Alternative Subplot Hooks

- **The Whisperers of Leoric’s Hollow**, a group of **feral druids**, want to **harvest Mimi** for her seed.
    
- **The Echo Beneath** sends agents to retrieve “the last living seed of the Root-Priest,” believing Mimi is a **key to regenerating** one of their lost cult leaders.
    
- **Mimi’s dreams become maps**, pointing toward buried **sporemind relics** or forgotten Druid temples.
