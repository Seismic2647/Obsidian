Perfect. Let’s rewrite and structure this moment cleanly into a **narrative combat encounter**, respecting the mystery around Moreina and making this feel like a _chaotic, tragic spillover_ from the massacre at Stormcamp.

We'll build tension with the scent and smoke, then crash right into the **chase-and-rescue combat** with bandits—low-tier but cinematic. Afterward, the refugees can either offer a few cryptic hints or flee in panic, continuing the tone of desperation and displacement.

## 🌄 REWRITTEN SCENE: _The Bleeding Sky_

**Location:** Outer Ridge of the Khanduras Pass  
**Time:** Twilight  
**Weather:** Winds carrying ash and iron  
**Environment:** Craggy slopes above the Cold Plains, cut by sharp ridges and sparse, wind-twisted trees.

---

### 🎭 Scene Setup

The pass narrows, flanked by jagged rockfaces. Below, the fading sun bathes the Cold Plains in a bloody orange glow.

**Smoke trails** rise on the horizon — thick and black. Azure smells **burnt leather, scorched meat, and copper blood**. The winds shift. A sound — metal clashing and hooves pounding earth — drifts up from the path ahead.

Just around the bend, she sees them:

- **Four bloodied figures**—two adults and two older children—scrambling up the pass trail.
    
- Behind them: **Seven mounted bandits**, clad in spiked leathers and wielding rusted axes or hooked swords, riding mangy desert horses. They’re laughing. Hunting.
    
- One bandit raises a **crossbow** toward the nearest child.
    

They haven’t seen Azure yet.

### 🧃 Optional Pre-Combat Choices:

1. **Ambush with elemental manipulation** – Melt the ground beneath the bandits’ mounts, hurl a burst of wind to unseat them, or split the trail with a stone spike.
    
2. **Run in fists blazing** – Get surprise round if Azure sprints and attacks from cover.
    
3. **Use illusion/diversion** – Disorient the bandits with flame illusions, thunderclaps, or a mimicry of more guards coming.
    
4. **Let them pass, then follow quietly** – Risk the refugees being slain, but could discover something useful on their bodies or among the bandits.

### 🎲 Combat Notes:

- Azure can use terrain creatively: ledges, boulders, wind gusts.
    
- Allow flashy elemental moments: _kick a burning brand into a horse’s face_, _freeze a slope to send a rider tumbling_, etc.
    
- Bandits are not honorable. They target the weak and will flee once the fight turns.

## 🧍 Refugee Aftermath (Choose Based on Tone)

1. **They flee mid-battle** – One yells “They burned the camp—everyone’s dead!” and sprints. Azure gets no further info.
    
2. **They remain and thank her** – Offer a **minor item**: a carved **Askari pendant** bearing a sun sigil (later relevant to Moreina’s followers).
    
3. **One is wounded** and delirious, mutters:
    
    > “She told us to run… the child of the elements… you were in the dreams.”  
    > (Hinting they recognize Azure from prophecy/dreams)
    

---

## 🎁 Optional Loot:

- **Askari Pendant** (non-magical but symbolic; triggers recognition from Moreina in future)
    
- **Bandit Ledger** (found on Enforcer) listing names, contracts, and a strange rune matching the **Echo Beneath’s sigil**
    
- **Horse or Bandit gear** if Azure wants to take trophies
