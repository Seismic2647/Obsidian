### 1. _The Vestibule of Sighs_

A long, low room filled with **rows of overturned pews** and hanging **moss chandeliers**. Dozens of **skeletal hands** reach from the ceiling like stalactites. If touched, they twitch faintly but do nothing more — for now.

- At the far end, a **door of water** ripples unnaturally, held in place like a curtain. When passed through, the body feels briefly **weightless**, and each character experiences a **vision** from their past — something painful they thought they’d buried.
    

🎲 _Sanity Check (DC 12)_ — Failure results in **disadvantage on Insight and Investigation** rolls while inside the chapel.
