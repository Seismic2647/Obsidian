- Potion or death
```The players arrive in a dark room.

in the middle of the room there is a table wirh 5 cups filled each with a different color liquid. A simple look a the table will reveal runes saying "drink from the green cup"

To pass, all they need to do is drink from the green cup. However there will not be enough liquid for everyone. The answer is that mixing the blue and the yellow cup will also produce green.

That's not the catch though. The real funny part is to see players agonizing over if they should follow the instructions or not. Surely it's too simple. What if the green cup is poisoned? what if all of the cup are poisoned?

Place the cups in antimagic field if one of the player has detect poison and diseases for more paranoia.

puzzel met letters = cijfers? A1 Z26
Dark vision specifically says you look in gray scale
Leuk voor in de mix, groene cups voor blauw/geel gebruiken, groene liquid in zeg rode cup, andere kleuren ook in anders gekleurde cups
duidelijk maken drink a sip, geen kleine sips

- tekst in gekleurde letters voor als iedereen vision dingen heeft


- party valt in een trap/put, zit vol olie/teer , hoe dan ook lichtontvlambaar. Door een gat in de stenen valt het (maan?) licht op een kaars.. Om eruit te komen moeten ze een magisch woord zeggen. De muur staat vol met woorden, maar welk woord moeten ze hebben?  (cijferreeks is leuker, maar dan moet het slot ook anders worden).

- Kamer vol leuke dingen, paar grote standbeelden met moeilijke shit of makkelijke dingen

The trick to making players feel smart is to give them a puzzle with a lot of right answers and no wrong ones. The challenge comes in doing that while still making it a puzzle. One puzzle like this I did was what I called the 'item lock'. Basically, theres a door in a well furnished room, with a slot/pedestal/whatever where you can put an item. The door has the riddle "The key is all that you can see, use what you find to go through me, but be aware of what you use, for that with life shall be renewed." The players can put anything in, and the door will unlock, but that item will become animate, and attack them. The beauty of this puzzle is that the players can use anything, and you can just reflavour a stat block for something else (or just the animate objects stats if you are lazy) for it. No item in the room is wrong, but the players realise some things may be stronger than others, which still means they have to think about it. Some notable examples from when I ran it were: A small dragon statue that became a pseudodragon, a chest that became a mimic and an inkwell that became some grey ooze.

A couple points on how to use puzzles effectively:

Puzzles should thematically fit with the dungeon and serve a purpose. Ex: a kobold stronghold doesn't go along a puzzle that requires advanced magical knowledge, nor a puzzle that requires 4 players and a high strength check goes along the tower of the lonely wizard.

A good way to create puzzles For Dummies, is by presenting obvious/partly solved puzzles. A couple examples:

Near the entrance of the dungeon there's a big gate "guarded" by 3 statues: one hold a wizard staff, one that's missing a sword, one that's missing a bow. The statues are too big to hold the PCs weapon. Now you just need to place a big bow and a big sword somewhere in the dungeon, and the players will make the connection when they find them.

A room full of statues. Some of them can be rotated, some can not. The solution is to make the statues form a pattern, like all pointing to the middle, or all pointing north.

The group enters a gallery. All paintings are of the same room, but some paintings have more objects than others. The objective is to reorder the paintings from the one with less depicted objects to the one with the most depicted objects.

```

```
As they enter the room, both doors slam shut. A red number appears above the opposite door: 59…58…57…56…

The room is empty except for a single green button on a pedestal in the center. Pushing the button resets the timer.

When the timer reaches 10 or less the room begins to rumble and pulse with red light. When the timer reaches 0, the rumbling and pulsing light stop and both doors swing harmlessly open.

Then you just sit back and watch your players repeatedly press the button while frantically trying everything they can think of to escape. It’s a good time!

It took my players a solid 20 minutes on this one. (Not including combat)

A door stands before the players, a three shadowy figures look back at the players, each holding a different object. A geode, a piece of parchment, and a pair of sheers. Below each of them a keyhole. The door is magically sealed, lockpicking DC 25, but all 3 must be done at the same time.

Three keys marked with the same symbol (geode, parchment, sheers) are needed. The correct key must go into the correct keyhole.

It's rock, paper, scissors the key that beats it is the correct key.

Alternatively, if you don't want the players to go on a scavenger hunt. Holes that can fit a hand can be used instead. Again, winning rock, paper, scissors opens the door.

As for combat, the way I had ran it, I made the shadowy figures actual Shadows that resided in the door. They only attack on lockpicks (passed or failed), attacking the door, or wrong answers. They only gave the answer wrong once when I ran it. Your choice if there is another set inside.

Good old SIMON.

A sequence of coloured lights or sounds plays, which the players have to replicate from memory somehow. Coloured crystals, a magical harp, you name it.

If they fail, then a trap activates or monsters appear. Easy at first, then harder and harder.

If they succeed, a longer, more complex sequence plays, until you think they’ve suffered enough. Then the door opens etc.

kan in een paleis of iets zijn van lord Konami, hints naar de code
```

- iets heel hoog verstoppen en de spelers op mekaar stapelen

- pratende deur/standbeeld/iets die je moet overhalen het passwoord te zeggen.
  
  eventueel met extreem lange naam

- laat de player een riddle aan een npc vragen, alleen als de npc het correcte antwoord geeft mag de player naar binnen. Als het geen makkelijk raadsel is verpesten ze het voor zichzelf. Het ego van de speler zal hier belangrijk zijn. - Hoe weten ze dit moeten doen, dit kan door een andere npc/deur bewaker die dit zegt (bijvoorbeel, oh dit is piet, master of riddels, knows all the answers, make up a new riddle, if he guesses correct you can enter)
