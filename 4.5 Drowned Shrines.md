Perfect — the Fields of Misery loosen their grip behind the party as they push onward, and the land itself seems to grow heavier underfoot. The sky is a dull gray, smeared with oily black clouds that churn without wind. A **bitter stench of swamp gas, old meat, and rusted iron** curls through the air. Ravens wheel in tight circles overhead, silent for once.

## 🌊 Transition to the _Drowned Shrines_

The path ahead becomes fragmented. No longer a proper trail, the route breaks into **soggy depressions and shattered stone paths** choked with brambles and fetid water. The air grows humid and close, almost soupy — each breath feels thick. Crooked trees lean over the trail like mourners frozen mid-sob, their roots drinking from drowned graves.

Here in the _Drowned Shrines_, the ruins of an old religious site lie scattered beneath the murky pools. Time and something far darker than erosion has buried the temple beneath **algae and grief**.

### 🗺 You see ahead:

1. A **sunken chapel**, barely visible beneath a still green pool. The top of a steeple pokes from the water like a skeletal finger. Moss-covered statuary gazes blankly from beneath the surface.
    
2. A **cracked stone causeway** winds toward a dry islet where a **crumbling effigy of a priestess** stands — her face eroded, her arms outstretched toward the marsh as if begging forgiveness or calling to something beneath.
    
3. The sound of **bells**, though distant and irregular, chimes from nowhere in particular. They are not wind-blown, and they have no rhythm. They sound underwater.

### 🌧 Environment Effects:

- **Constant Difficult Terrain**: Movement is slowed due to muck and knee-high water.
    
- **Skill Checks involving perception or sound are at disadvantage** due to the weird resonance in the air and the muffling effect of the swamp.
    
- Once per hour, a **Wisdom saving throw (DC 11)** is required to resist the oppressive grief of the place. Failure causes **1 level of exhaustion** from emotional weight — can be prevented with inspirational roleplay or clerical magic (e.g., _Bless_ or _Inspiration_).

### 👁 Optional Encounter (non-combat):

The party notices a **solitary figure in the distance**, waist-deep in the water. Cloaked, unmoving. If they approach, they find it is a **drowned priest**, bound to the muck by black chains. His lips move, but no sound emerges. Around his neck hangs a waterlogged holy symbol — warped by age and rot.

- **Touching the symbol** triggers a **brief vision**: the chapel, intact, packed with weeping villagers as the priest screams, "DO NOT LET THEM IN!" — before the doors burst open and water pours in like a tidal wave.
    
- The priest’s spirit cannot be freed — but taking his **holy symbol** may prove useful later (it emits faint light and wards off low-level undead).
