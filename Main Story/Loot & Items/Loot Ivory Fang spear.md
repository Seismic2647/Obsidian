**Features:**

- **Never Dulls:**  
    The weapon ignores resistance to non-magical piercing damage.
    
- **Pale Thirst:**  
    Once per turn, when you hit with Ivory Fang, you can force the target to make a **DC 13 Constitution saving throw**. On a failure, the creature suffers **disadvantage on its next attack roll** as pale, sapping energy seeps from the wound.
    
- **Moonfang Precision (1/long rest):**  
    After making an attack roll with the spear, you can choose to reroll it **after seeing the result**, but before knowing if it hits or misses.
