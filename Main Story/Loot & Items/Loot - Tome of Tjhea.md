### 🕯️ THE TOME OF Tjhea (zeg TJEAH , cambodjaans voor huis)

A **weightless tome**, bound in flesh-colored vellum and edged with tarnished gold, floats silently in the center of the room. Carved upon its cover is a broken halo and an angel’s tear. When touched, the tome trembles gently… and opens.

Inside are **two scrolls**, glowing faint blue. Their edges shift as if made of mist and silk.

> _Inscribed upon each is a single word, written in the Celestial tongue "Tjeah' —the word means both “home” and “end.”_
> 
> _These are scrolls of Town Portal._  
> _Each scroll can be used **once** to tear a rift between worlds, opening a glowing portal that leads directly to the **square of a town where Recognision and potatoes are found**._  
> _They shimmer with ancient power, older even than the Horadrim, remnants of the same light Virelliel once sang into the void._
