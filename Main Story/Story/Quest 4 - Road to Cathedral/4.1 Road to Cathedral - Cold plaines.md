## ‚ùÑÔ∏è The Cold Plains (Return Journey)

**Time of Day:** Early morning ‚Äî the sky is bruised with deep purples and reds. A chill wind howls across the cracked, frostbitten plains.  
**Weather:** Overcast. Thin flakes of ash drift through the air like snow, but the stench betrays their origin‚Äîburnt flesh and bone.  
**Environment:** Sparse, gnarled trees twist like blackened skeletons against the horizon. The soil here is thin and sickly; dry grass crunches underfoot like brittle parchment. Crows feast in the distance‚Äîtoo fat, too silent.

### üî• Scene Opening: The Path of Memory

As the trio crosses into the Cold Plains once more, the memories of their recent battles rise like specters. The charred remains of **Stormcamp** loom ahead, collapsed tents blackened and scattered. The corpses of fallen warriors‚Äîfriend and foe alike‚Äîstill litter the ground. Time has not been kind here. No burial. No peace.

The wind whistles mournfully through the scorched banners bearing the Stormcamp‚Äôs sigil: a crimson bolt cleaving a blackened mountain.

Nearby, a broken spear has been stuck into the soil‚Äîlikely by a surviving Stormcamper. Atop it, a **wolf skull**, its hollow eyes filled with melted candlewax. A makeshift shrine, or perhaps a warning.

### üïØ Event: The Whispering Ashes

==voor vertrek perc or surv check voor crypyt==

As the players pass the shrine, they feel it‚Ä¶ a pulse. The air grows colder‚Äînot from the elements, but from _memory_. Sybil hears the faintest of whispers in Infernal. Azure senses an imbalance‚Äî_the land remembers blood._ Bo hears nothing, but smells something strange‚Ä¶ rain on dry bone or is it just the potatoes he ate earlier

> From the shrine, a voice manifests‚Äînot from the skull, but from the wind itself.

**"Mothers and daughters burned alike. The storm scattered. But not all are dead... some scream beneath the soil. You brought vengeance... but did you bring peace?"**

It vanishes with the next gust of wind.

Let the players react freely. There is no combat here‚Äîyet. But allow this to be an eerie roleplay beat. A moment of reflection or investigation.

### üß≠ Path to the Dark Woods

As the Cold Plains roll behind them, the grass thins and the land sours. Fewer birds sing. The ground becomes moist, footsteps sinking into muddy ruts. Charred plains give way to dense shadow as the treeline thickens in the distance.

The edge of the **Dark Woods** rises like a wall of black teeth.
