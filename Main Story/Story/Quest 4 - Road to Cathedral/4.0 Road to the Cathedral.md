### 🛡️ Encounter: Watch Captain Harland's Summons

_The sky over Tristram is bruised violet, the last fingers of daylight slipping beneath the jagged treeline. A damp chill hangs in the air, thick with the scent of old ash and wet stone. Just as the heroes step away from the apothecary — Heartroot delivered, souls still heavy — the sharp clank of armored boots cuts across the cobbled square._

_From the shadows between flickering braziers emerges **Watch Captain Harland**: a weathered man in dark lamellar armor, scarred cheek and graying beard, his hand resting habitually on the pommel of a worn longsword. A black sash marks him as one of the last remaining officers of Tristram’s failing militia. His voice is low, edged like cold steel._

> **Harland:**  
> _“I heard you came back in one piece.”_  
> _(He studies them a moment, eyes flicking over the dirt, blood, and wear clinging to Bo’s boots and Sybil’s cloak.)_  
> _“Didn’t think you would. Most don’t.”_

> _(He steps closer, lowering his voice.)_  
> _“There’s something you need to see. Out past the old wood trail, where the swamps begin — the Black Marsh.”_

> **Harland (grimly):**  
> _“Scout came back from there last night. Half-mad. Eyes gone white. Kept mumbling about hymns in the dark, and bones that walk.”_

> _(He pauses. Watches them.)_

> **Harland:**  
> _“You’ve heard the name. _Leoric_. Cursed king of old Khanduras. They say hes beneath the Cathedral ruins."

> _(He shakes his head, tone hardening.)_  
> _“I can’t spare men. Not for this. But you… you might be the only ones left in this gods-forsaken town that have _any_ hope of making it out there alive.”_

> _(He takes a step back, voice carrying the weight of a man used to giving orders to corpses.)_  
> _“Gear up. Take whatever supplies you need. Once you're ready, head north of the cold plains, towards the black mash, you will pass the Fields of Misery, the dark woords and the drowned shrines. If the Cathedral’s still there… that is...
> you'll know it when you'll see it. And if you dont.. The dead tend to make noise.”_

> _(He turns, but glances back once more.)_

> **Harland (quietly):**  
> _“Find out what’s stirring in the dark. And if you _do_ find Leoric… may the gods help you.”_
