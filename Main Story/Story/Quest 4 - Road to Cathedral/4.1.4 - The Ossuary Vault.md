The air here is _stifling_ despite the cold. **Candles** flicker on their own as the party enters. The chamber is octagonal, with **walls covered in skulls and bones**, arranged in artistic, almost reverent patterns.

In the center of the room sits a blackened **altar**, atop which lies a **crown of rusted iron and broken rubies**. Despite its damaged appearance, the moment anyone draws close, the air _presses down_ ‚Äî as though the crypt itself is holding its breath.

### üîÆ The Crown of the Forgotten King

_Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)_

> This crown once belonged to a king who believed death could be outrun. When worn, the user gains:

- **+1 to Intimidation and Persuasion checks** involving royalty, nobility, or undead.
    
- Once per day, you may **cast _Command_** (DC 13) without expending a spell slot.
    
- However, each day it is worn beyond the first, roll a **DC 13 Wisdom save**. On a failure, the wearer hears whispers of the king's voice urging betrayal and grandeur. Due to the whispers you have a -2 on all throws due to being distracted constantly.
    

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Curse Roll

Before anyone can claim the crown, the player must make a **DC 12 Charisma Saving Throw** as they reach for it. If successful, they may take the crown safely. If failed:

- The character is afflicted with the **Curse of the Watchful Dead** for 24 hours.
    
- Until the curse ends:
    
    - They have **disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception)** checks involving sight.
        
    - They experience nightmarish visions whenever they close their eyes ‚Äî including _one fleeting glimpse of King Leoric‚Äôs pale face beneath a shattered crown_.
        

The curse can be removed by _Restoration_ or sleeping within consecrated ground.
