A circular chamber, dry but **echoing with the sound of water** that isnâ€™t present. In the center rests a **raised stone slab**, upon which lies a **silver crown encrusted with barnacles**, known as:

### ðŸ§  Item: _Crown of Vellune's Last Breath_

- Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)
    
- When worn, grants the wearer **resistance to necrotic damage** and the ability to **breathe underwater**.
    
- Once per long rest, the wearer may cast _Speak with Dead_ (but only if the corpse has drowned).
    

ðŸŽ² _Arcana or Religion Check (DC 14)_ to attune safely.  
Failure results in a **1-day curse**: the wearer is constantly wet and gasps as if drowning. Disadvantage on Constitution saves and disadvantage on Initiative.
