### ðŸŒ‘ CHAPEL ENTRANCE

Once submerged, the **party must hold their breath** (or use magical means) as they descend. After 20 feet underwater, they find an **air pocket** inside a broken narthex chamber. Dripping wet, shivering, they stand in a slanted hallway carved of **bone-white stone**, painted with ancient murals depicting:

- A **procession of pilgrims**, robes weighted with stones.
    
- A **dark god** of drowning â€” no name given, only a symbol: a **spiral vortex ringed with eyes**.
    
- The **"Anointment by Immersion"**, where a priest submerges a willing supplicant until the water goes still.
    

A trail of **wet footprints** leads further inâ€¦ but theyâ€™re bare, small, and clawed.
