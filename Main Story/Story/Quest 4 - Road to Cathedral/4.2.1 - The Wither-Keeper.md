**Appearance:**  
A gaunt, skeletal figure emerges from between two bark-split trees, his naked body draped in vines and ragged moss. His skin is pale gray, veined with throbbing black lines that pulse like root systems under the flesh. His eyes weep thin trails of blood, and where his fingernails should be, twisted black thorns curve like talons. His long, brittle hair hangs in clumps, swaying as if caught in an unseen breeze.

**Mannerisms:**  
He speaks in rhymes and riddles. His voice is wet, gurgling, but eerily calm, as if every word comes from deep within the earth.  
He does not blink. Ever.

### **Dialogue (initial interaction):**

> **Wither-Keeper**:  
> _"Tread soft, ye bold souls, for roots do bite..._  
> _This soil is thick with grief and blight._  
> _Your steps have stirred what once lay low—_  
> _So speak your names, and let me know."_

If the players answer, he continues:

> _"I knew her, yes... the girl with eyes of fire._  
> _Her heartroot bloomed in funeral mire._  
> _They fed her soul to bark and bone—_  
> _She woke the woods. She walks alone."_

> _"You seek the path? Then give the land its due—_  
> _Blood from the bold, a drop or two."_  
> _"Or ask your questions, if brave and wise..._  
> _But know: the woods don't care for lies."_

### **Interaction Options:**

1. **Offer Blood** – The Wither-Keeper takes a single drop of blood from each willing player. If all comply, he draws a rune in the dirt and reveals a hidden cache containing:
    
    - A **scroll of barkskin**
        
    - A pouch of **Withered Seeds** (1d4 feet coverage, can be planted to create temporary cover or difficult terrain in combat)
        
2. **Ask About Lirael / Sanguinax** –  
    He shudders violently, grasping at his chest:
    
    > _"Bound she was. A cage of flesh..._  
    > _But demons slip through roots so fresh._  
    > _I sealed her soul with bark and brand—_  
    > _Still failed to stop the demon’s hand."_  
    > He coughs up black sap and weeps. He then offers one cryptic prophecy:  
    > _“When the moon drowns in the holy fire...  
    > Then the King shall wear his rot with pride.”_
    
3. **Try to Purify Him** – Clerics or divine casters may attempt _Remove Curse_ or _Lesser Restoration_. If successful, his true form is revealed: **Druid Kelreth**, one of the old circle once tasked with containing Sanguinax. He weeps as he dissolves into vines and leaves behind a staff (see item below).
    
4. **Attack Him** – He lets out a rasping chuckle:
    
    > _"Steel and spells? Yes... oh yes..._  
    > _The roots shall feast upon your flesh."_  
    > And rises into the air, vines bursting from the ground as the **Wither-Keeper** takes his true form.
