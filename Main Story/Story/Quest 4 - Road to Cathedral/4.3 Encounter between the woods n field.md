Absolutely — a mid-journey combat encounter fits the pacing well and raises the stakes as the party transitions into the dreaded _Fields of Misery_. Here's a **dark, atmospheric encounter** designed to be medium difficulty for your 3-player, level 3 party. It occurs in a **desolate, overgrown clearing** where the sickly remains of the Dark Wood begin to rot into the cursed soil of the Fields.

## ⚔️ **Encounter: Rot Below the Roots**

### 📍 Setting:

As the forest begins to thin and the air grows rank, the trees no longer whisper — they _wheeze_. The earth is soft and spongy, thick with decayed plant matter and pale fungi. A half-buried **statue of a weeping angel**, broken at the waist, sits slumped in the mud. A ring of shattered grave markers surrounds it, some carved in languages long dead. Buzzing flies circle the muck.

As the party approaches the angel, the ground twitches.

A low rumble is followed by the _crack_ of a splitting root and the _wail_ of something inhuman below. Muck bubbles and bursts, revealing not one but several blasphemous forms: long-dead warriors, buried without rites, now **twisted by the magic bleeding from the Fields**.

### 🧠 Encounter Features

- **Weeping Angel Statue:**  
    A successful **DC 13 Religion or Arcana check** reveals this statue once marked the edge of the holy lands—before they were swallowed by the curse. If _cleansed_ (via a spell like _Lesser Restoration_ or _Prestidigitation_ + holy water), the angel releases a **single beam of light** and **heals the party 1d4 HP each**.
    
- **Uneasy Ground:**  
    The battlefield is 30 x 30 feet, uneven and soggy. Falling prone here risks sinking further into the rot—players must use half movement to stand _and_ make a DC 10 Athletics check to avoid being restrained for a turn.

### 🪓 Party Action Options:

1. **Charge into the clearing and take control of the angel’s high ground**, using the statue for cover and tactical advantage. {1}
    
2. **Try to exorcise or cleanse the area mid-battle**, hoping the light of the angel statue disrupts the undead. {2}
    
3. **Use the unstable ground to bait enemies into traps**, forcing Dex saves to knock them prone and vulnerable. {3}
    
4. **Sybil could ignite the fungal bloom with fire magic**, potentially harming everyone (including the party) but clearing a path or causing damage over time. {4}
    
5. **Bo tries to wear the angel’s broken wings as armor and intimidate the undead.** It does nothing mechanically but is epic. {5}
