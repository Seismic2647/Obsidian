## 💀 **Encounter: The Bridge-Troll of the Weeping Causeway**

### 🗺️ **Setting**

As the party leaves the last of the Drowned Shrines behind, a **broken causeway rises** out of the water — the only dry path toward the Black Marsh. Moss-covered stones form a thin trail above the muck, and **a half-submerged stone bridge** juts over a sinkhole lake, thick with algae and bones.

Perched atop the shattered span is a **massive, swamp-caked creature** — its limbs gangly and long, its belly distended and quivering with glee. **Wet gurgling laughter** echoes through the mist.

> **"YOU! Meat-things! This bridge is _mine_. You cross, you pay — in gold... or guts."**

### 👹 **Swamp Troll, “Retchgut”**

_A grotesque scavenger of the drowned lands, banished by its kin for feeding on the dead rather than the living. Now it takes tolls in bone and bile._

**Lair Feature:**
