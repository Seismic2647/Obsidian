The sky darkens as the Cold Plains vanish behind you. Wind howls across the dying grass, and the skeletal remains of Moreina’s old Stormcamp seem to watch silently as you vanish into the deeper reaches of Sanctuary. Your boots meet soil not yet dry—the woods await. The **Dark Woods** rise like a wall of withered limbs, clawing at the stormy sky. What sunlight remains is devoured beneath their twisted boughs, and within moments of entering, the road dissolves into a narrow, root-choked trail winding deeper into a forest both ancient and wounded.

## **THE DARK WOODS**

_Time of Day:_ Twilight. A sickly orange sun fights the overcast sky.  
_Weather:_ Humid. Rot and ozone fill the air. You can taste the decay.  
_Ambience:_ Crows scream above. Trees lean too close, with bark like blistered skin. You swear some trunks exhale mist.  
_Known Events:_ This is where the party found Lirael—the apothecary's daughter—possessed by the demon Sanguinax. Her cries and whispers may still echo in the roots.

## **Narrative Opening: Returning to Old Shadows**

As the party steps beyond the last of the plains, the forest swallows sound. The chirp of birds, the whistle of wind—gone. Only the crunch of boots on sodden moss remains.

A massive tree lies fallen across the trail, its trunk split down the middle like it burst from within. The sap is red and sticky, and the scent is _not_ entirely plantlike. Beneath its twisted roots, the faint glow of forgotten glyphs hum quietly, as if remembering the last time this place was breached by evil.

The players remember too—_this_ is where Lirael was found. Her laughter, twisted and unnatural, briefly echoes on the breeze before dying again.

## **Scene Event: “The Grave Bloom”**

As they make their way down a familiar path, the players spot something new: a field of crimson flowers growing from a sunken patch of forest. These **graveblooms** were not here before.

> _Each bloom is shaped like a screaming face. They pulse faintly in the gloom, and the air around them buzzes with unseen flies._

If the party investigates (roll), they notice that the flowers are growing from **a shallow pit of bodies**—recent, and entirely bloodless. Their bones are dry, their faces contorted. One still clutches a **torn journal page**.

> **Journal Fragment:**  
> “We thought we could trap it. Ward it. Bind it in that damned girl. But the roots listened. They took her. And now it whispers through the trees, hungry still. Sanguinax has her.”

## **Optional Interaction:**

A gaunt **old man**, naked save for a ragged satchel, steps from behind a tree. His skin is veined with black rot. His eyes are weeping blood.

**The Wither-Keeper** (Kelreth - name still unknown untill purified.  can refer to himself as 'I don't remember my name, due to rot of the brain')

- Speaks in rhyme.
    
- Refers to Sybil as “the one who woke the ground.”
    
- Offers to trade knowledge for **a single drop of blood from each hero**, gathered willingly.
    
- Warns cryptically: “_The Woods remember. But they also forget—until you feed them again._”
    

**Secret:** He is a druid whose spirit was bound here after failing to contain Sanguinax long ago. If questioned directly about Lirael, he will shake and vanish in a gust of leaves.

## **Exit Path & Encounter Setup**

The woods darken further. The trail begins to slope downward into **a moss-covered ravine**, where the air grows chill and wet. Something _old_ and _watchful_ lies ahead.

Before reaching the Fields of Misery, a **final obstacle** emerges: a gnarled wooden effigy covered in entrails blocks the path, twitching.

A single word is carved in bone at its base: **“RETURN”**.

To proceed, the heroes must either:

- **Burn the effigy** with fire or radiant magic.
    
- **Defile it with blood** (each party member must cut themselves).
    
- **Speak the name of the demon they banished**.
    

Each action could have consequences. Burning it may weaken the woods’ grip. Blood may attract... attention. Speaking Sanguinax’s name risks more than echoes.

## **Player Options**

As the party stands before the effigy, thick with buzzing flies and dark magic, they may:

1. {**Burn the effigy** using magical or mundane fire—potentially drawing attention from a lurking spirit.}
    
2. {**Cut themselves and drip blood upon the base**, appeasing the woods but leaving them cursed for a day (disadvantage on death saves).}
    
3. {**Speak the name “Sanguinax” aloud**, shaking the woods and drawing a shriek from deep beneath the earth.}
    
4. {**Attempt to sneak around through a denser part of the forest**, risking disorientation and a random encounter.}
    
5. {**Place the torn journal page onto the effigy**, which causes it to burn away harmlessly and reveal a hidden trail.}
