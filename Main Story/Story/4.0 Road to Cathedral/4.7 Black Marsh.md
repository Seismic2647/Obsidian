Excellent. You’ve traversed the haunted hollows, survived the Fields of Misery, and now the mire begins to thin. The smell of brine and decay fades into the crisp scent of damp pine and charred earth. The road ahead rises and hardens underfoot — old cobblestone, partially sunken, leading into the **Black Marsh**.

### 📍 _The Black Marsh_

**Time:** Late Afternoon, though the canopy makes it feel like twilight  
**Weather:** Chilling breeze; a thin drizzle begins  
**Environment:** Barren pine trees, scattered ancient ruins, heavy air of foreboding  
**Ambience:** The caw of distant carrion birds, the faint clang of rusted iron in the wind

Once sacred, now desecrated, the **Black Marsh** was once a route of pilgrimage to the Cathedral — the seat of Leoric’s power before his descent into madness. Now, nature and time claw it into ruin. The trail is overgrown, flanked by **dead trees and shattered statues**. Stone watchtowers dot the edges of the marshland, some toppled, others barely standing, their old banners long devoured by wind and rain.

In the distance, **black spires** rise like rotten teeth on the horizon — the **Cathedral** awaits.

### 📌 First Steps Into the Marsh – Event: The Echo Gate

The party stumbles across a **cracked stone archway**, grown over with ivy and fungus. A **plaque**, barely readable, is set into the base:

> _"Only those with purpose may enter Leoric’s domain. Speak, and be judged."_

As they approach, a faint **ethereal voice** echoes from within the arch:

> _“Before you stands the end of all reason. Turn back, or speak your cause, and pass into madness.”_

This is a minor magical test. Each hero is invited (not forced) to state **why they are entering the Cathedral**. It’s not about truth — it’s about conviction.

- If the players speak confidently, the arch pulses with pale light and lets them pass.
    
- If they joke, hesitate, or lie poorly (Insight DC 14 reveals this), the arch remains inert.
    
- If they attempt to force passage, it will **howl with banshee-like force**, knocking them prone and forcing a Charisma saving throw (DC 13) to resist psychic damage (2d6).
    

This scene is **meant for flavor**, not punishment — an atmospheric challenge to reinforce tone.

### 📌 Discovery: The Bone Orchard

Beyond the gate, they find a **grove of stunted trees**, each hung with **torn banners**, old **helmets**, and **bones tied with twine**. This is the **Bone Orchard** — a battlefield turned memorial.

A successful Perception or Survival check (DC 13) reveals signs of recent movement — the **bones have been rearranged**. Closer inspection shows them stacked in patterns: **spirals**, **sigils**, and **watchful runes**.

- Sybil can identify this as **necrotic warding magic**, meant to **hold something in**, not out.
    
- Azure might notice **monk script** in some of the carvings — written upside-down.
    
- Bo finds a **massive broken blade** buried in the soil — engraved with **the crest of Tristram’s old militia**, long thought wiped out.
    

It’s clear: something still lives here — or _refuses to die_.

### 📌 Approaching the Cathedral

After the marsh opens, a ridge rises — and atop it, cast in shadows even at dusk, stands **Leoric’s Cathedral**. The once-glorious temple has been defiled; its stained glass shattered, its tower split. Gargoyles perch like carrion beasts. A foul **green light** flickers in the windows.

As the players approach, they feel it — the oppressive weight of unseen eyes. Something watches. _And waits._

They are close now. One more push, and they cross into **Leoric’s fallen sanctum**.
