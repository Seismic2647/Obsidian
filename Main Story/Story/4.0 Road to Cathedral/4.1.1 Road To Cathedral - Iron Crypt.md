**Trigger:** A successful **DC 14 Survival or Perception check** while passing a jagged bluff overlooking the icy grasslands.

The cold wind carries an unnatural scent â€” _ozone and rust_. Behind a weathered stone outcrop, partially buried in frost-hardened earth, the party uncovers the remnants of an ancient structure. A **sealed iron door**, arched and runed, juts from the hillside like a broken tooth. Its surface is ice-cold to the touch and etched with an unfamiliar **sigil of chains wrapping a cracked crown**.

The door is ajar. Inside is a narrow stair spiraling downward into the frozen soil, swallowed by darkness. 
When you're about half way , the party finds a room with a **single stone coffin**. You can either enter or continue down the stairs. The stone coffin is, surrounded by old bones â€” _not buried, but kneeling_, as if in prayer. One skeletal hand clutches a **scroll tube**, still intact.

dex/slight of hand roll? If fail it goes to optional effect.

> **Inside the scroll tube** is a brittle parchment bearing a sketch of **the Cathedral at Black Marsh**â€”but different. _Older._ The spire is broken, and above it floats a symbol: **a black sun bleeding smoke**. No text. Just the image.

**Arcana or Religion DC 15:**  
This version of the Cathedral predates Zakarumic rule. The black sun symbol is ancient and rarely seen â€” associated with forbidden prophecy and the **Cycle of Returning Kings** â€” a cursed line said to die in madness and rise in undeath.

### ðŸ’€ Optional Effect:

If the party disturbs the coffin or desecrates the crypt, a **Wight (adjusted for Level 3 balance)** might rise â€” or better yet, you could have them feel _watched_, hear whispers in dead languages, or suffer from a one-day curse: _-1 to all Saving Throws vs. Fear until consecrated at holy ground._

---

This adds a layer of eerie history to the Cold Plains, foreshadows the darkness festering in the Cathedral, and reinforces the feeling that the _land itself remembers the dead_. Would you like me to stat out a custom creature for this crypt if disturbed?
