The next room is a **circular crypt chamber**, with five **stone thrones** arranged around a broken dais (platform thing). Each throne bears a carved symbol:

1. A **Crown**
    
2. A **Sword**
    
3. A **Flame**
    
4. A **Skull**
    
5. A **Mirror**
    

On the dais lies a **sixth symbol** — _a shattered throne_ — and a riddle inscribed in High Gothic:

> _“He who would rule again must stand among his peers —  
> But not where they sit, lest he be chained again.”_

To proceed, the players must realize that the **correct place to stand** is the center **between** the five thrones — _but not on the broken throne’s mark_. Standing on any of the actual throne sigils triggers a harmless magical shock (1 psychic damage, just enough to startle).

> **Solution:** The player must step into the space **between** the thrones, _not_ on a symbol. When done correctly, the room trembles slightly, and the back wall slides open with a low groan, revealing a stair down to the final room.
