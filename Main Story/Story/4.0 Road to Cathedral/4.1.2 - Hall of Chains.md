The stairs end in a vast chamber — a **stone hall 30 feet wide and 80 feet long**, lit faintly by the glow of **phosphorescent moss** blooming in the cracks between the flagstones. The walls are lined with rusted **iron chains**, hanging from ceiling hooks. Dozens of them sway gently despite the still air, as if recently disturbed.

At the far end stands a **massive stone door**, engraved with **three crowned heads**, all blindfolded. Between them is a carved inscription in Old Khanduran:

> _“In silence we bound him. In blindness he returned.”_

If anyone speaks aloud near the chains, they all _shudder violently_ — and the door seals with a _metallic hiss_. Only complete silence (no talking, spellcasting, or combat) for one full minute causes the chains to fall still and allow passage.

> **Passive Perception DC 12** or **Investigation DC 13** lets a character notice that footsteps echo louder when someone speaks — a subtle hint at the silence requirement.
