The Altar

Under a moonlit clearing, tree roots twist into a natural altar, trickling blood. Here, Lirael’s spirit manifests fully, desperate but fragmented her eyes glowing sorrowfully._  

_"The pact must end. Take the Heartroot, I beg you, and free me from this endless torment. But know—if the bind is broken, Sanguinax will rise, and Sanctuary will bleed anew."_

She tells you the truth: taking the Heartroot breaks the demon’s pact, freeing her soul but unleashing the demon, Sanguinax, long sealed beneath the forest.

Alternatively, you can offer something of value (memories, a small piece of your own life essence, etc.) to take only enough Heartroot to save Tristram, keeping the demon bound (but at a personal or party cost).

If heroes hesitate or wish to bargain:  
_"There is another way—offer a sacrifice of your own essence, so the demon remains sealed. Your blood, or the memories you cherish... What are you willing to pay?"_



Climax: The Pact’s Choice
Option 1: Take the Heartroot and break the pact. The earth shudders—a wave of blood magic erupts. Sanguinax bursts forth (or its cultists do), starting a new threat for the future!

Option 2: Barter or sacrifice to leave the demon bound. You save Tristram but at a personal cost. The forest remains cursed… for now.


Sanguinax is now loose, its cult seeks revenge.
The dryads hope for redemption.
The pact can be reforged or permanently broken—if you dare.
