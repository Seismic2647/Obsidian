**Path Description:** To the left, the ground becomes hard-packed mud soaked with blood. You hear clangs of steel on steel—not training. Execution. 


After a ==5 minute walk== they reach something that almost looks like a castle. when they enter the hallways here are wide, lit with iron lanterns whose flames sputter green. Along the walls hang **trophies**: the gear of her victims, twisted and reforged into new grotesque shapes.

A cracked stone arch bears her name in crude letters burned into a metal plate:  
**"VANYA - IRON IN HER VEINS"**

**Lair Description:** The chamber opens wide into a **pit-like arena**, dug into the ground like an old coliseum. The floor is scorched, and dozens of blades are stabbed upright into the earth in concentric circles—her personal “garden of war.”  
On the far end, resting on a black stone throne with spikes welded to its arms, sits **Vanya the Iron Bitch**.

Her armor is a **brutal patchwork**—a breastplate of gold goblin make, greaves stolen from a crusader, shoulderpads crafted from demonhide. Her right hand is entirely mechanical—**a crude metal gauntlet**, constantly sparking and twitching. The blade across her back is serrated, notched, and _wet_.

> **Vanya (if they enter):**  
> _"So. You’re the rats who’ve been crawling through my camp. Tell me—are you thieves, or fools looking for a queen to bury them?"_

> She rises with a slow, metallic screech.

🎲 Battle Notes:

- Her room is **built for her**: traps can be triggered (floor spikes, falling chains, flame jets from the wall).
    
- There are **hanging chains** and **weapon racks** that can be used by the party for clever tactics.
    
- A **pile of gear** behind her throne includes Moreina’s **spear**, gleaming faintly, untouched.
