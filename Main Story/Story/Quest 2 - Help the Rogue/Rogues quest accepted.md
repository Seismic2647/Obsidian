Onze helden gaan op pad! Exit west en ze komen na een klein uur lopen (encounter?) 

The first thing they notice is the **smoke**—a greasy plume curling up into the gray sky from behind a ridge. The scent follows next, **thick and stomach-churning**: a mix of ash, blood, piss, and burning flesh. Crows circle above like flies, shrieking hungrily.

As they crest the final rise, they see what’s left of Stormcamp.

It isn’t a battlefield. It’s a **slaughterhouse**.

Tents are ablaze or shredded, canvas flapping like flayed skin in the wind. The banners that once bore the proud spiral of #Moreina’s clan are trampled and soaked in gore. **Bodies lie everywhere—dozens of them**, most of them warriors. Some were killed cleanly with arrows or blades. Others... were not.
And the party sees it—**movement**.


Just beyond the main firepit, half-shielded by the wreckage of a collapsed tent, **a group of figures crouch and scavenge among the bodies**. Four of them. Maybe five. One is hacking at a corpse's chest with a short axe, trying to pry something loose. Another is drinking from a flask, smearing blood across his beard with each swig. 

Optioneel:
```
One stands lookout—until he turns and sees the party.

His eyes widen.  
He whistles once, sharp.

**The bandits are still here.**

They haven't finished their work.
