**Path Description:** A narrow wooden passage leads off to the right, past two overturned wagons smoldering with charred canvas. The air here is _still_â€”almost reverentâ€”and reeks of wet gold and stale blood. Along the walls, tattered banners hang: strips of cloaks, belts, armor from fallen enemies.  
Bootprints in the dirt lead inward, some human, some clawed. A single iron bell dangles above the entrance, silent and dust-covered.

A big wooden door with an enchanting red glow is in front of you. Opens with a key the iron bitch has , or a D18 or higher roll for lockpicking / str

**Room Description:** The **Treasure Room** isnâ€™t a vaultâ€”itâ€™s a shrine to greed and war. The walls are made of mismatched stone and bone, blood runes smeared across them in dried crimson. Torches burn blue in metal sconces shaped like screaming skulls. A weird smell is lingering around. 

Scattered across the room:

- **Crates of weapons**, broken and intact â€” some clearly foreign, others stolen from Tristram.
    
- A **stack of bones** carefully arranged in the center, jawbones tied with silver string.
    
- A **large locked chest**, covered in infernal markings. (DC 13 Investigation to discover: trapped. DC 15 Dex to disarm)
    
- A **pile of armor pieces and magical trinkets**, many mismatched, including:
    
    - **Moreinaâ€™s Bow**, but still humming with magical tension.
        
    - A **strange black key**, warm to the touch.
        
        

> _If they linger too long:_  
> A faint sound begins, like whispering voices arguing just beyond the walls. One wall begins to _bleed_.

ðŸŽ² Possible Challenges:

    
- Magical trap protecting Moreinaâ€™s gear (force explosion, 2d6).
    
- A **shadowy mimic** disguises itself as part of the treasure hoard. When they open the chest it lauches at them, exploding and blocking the way out. Now what?
