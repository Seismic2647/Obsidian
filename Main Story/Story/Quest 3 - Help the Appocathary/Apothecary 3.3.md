The Healer’s Memory : Lirael (apothecary daughter)
Demon: Sanguinax

You find a half-collapsed hut overgrown with bloody vines.

Inside:
A shattered mirror,
Some shatered dried up bones 
Rotted alchemy tools,
And a journal covered in dried blood.
Reading the journal (in Elvish or via magic) reveals the tale of Lirael, the healer

When reading the book, shreds of Liraels ghost start apearing like green misty light beams.
You start hearing her thin withered voice.

_"Long ago, I tried to save my children and my village by the blood pact. The demon (Sanguinax) took my soul; I bound myself so the forest would protect what I loved. But now, the sickness spreads beyond my control. The Heartroot you seek… it is the last key. Come to the altar when the  moon rises. There, we will decide the fate of us all."


If they try to summon her, they can ask about the demon:
_"Sanguinax waits beneath the roots, a nightmare bound by my love and pain. Break the pact, and the nightmare awakens. Uphold it, and the curse deepens. Choose wisely."_
