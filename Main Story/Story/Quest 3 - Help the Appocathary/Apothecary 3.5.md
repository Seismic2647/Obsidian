### ðŸ§ª Location: Tristram â€” The Apothecaryâ€™s Shop



 As the party approaches the small, crooked building with a faded mortar-and-pestle sign, a bell jingles softly overhead. The scent inside is of dried herbs, bitter oils, and old grief._

_The apothecary, **Master Quintus**, stands hunched over a workbench, lit by candlelight. His fingers are stained with ink and bloodwort. He turns as the door opens, eyes widening with a mix of hope and terror._

---

> **Quintus (softly, hoarse):**  
> _"By the old rootsâ€¦ you made it back."_

> _(His gaze drops when he doesnt see his daughter, but a faint spark of hope can be seen in his eyes when he spots the withered, veined lump of the **Heartroot**, sticking out of the bag of holding. It's still slick with dark ichor.)_

> **Quintus:**  
> _"Is thatâ€”? You found it. The real thing. After all this timeâ€¦"_

> _(He reaches out reverently, hands shaking as he takes the Heartroot into his palms. The candlelight flickers green for a moment, and a low _hum_ whispers from the root.)_

> **Quintus (voice thick):**  
> _"Thank you. Truly. There are few alchemies strong enough to fight the soul rotâ€¦ but thisâ€¦ this might give the dying a fighting chance. Even if they scream through it."_

> _(Then, a pause. His hands lower. His eyes meet Sybilâ€™s, then Boâ€™s.)_

> Quintus (quietly):**  
> _"...And my daughter? Did you find her?"_

### ðŸ§© Options Depending on Your Campaign

Here are three variations you can choose from depending on what youâ€™ve decided happened to Rennickâ€™s daughter.

---

#### ðŸ©¸ Option 1: Sheâ€™s Dead

> Quintus (after hearing the news):**  
> _"...Ah. I see. Was it quick?"_

> _(He nods slowly, shoulders trembling. After a long silenceâ€¦)_  
> _"Then sheâ€™s part of the Hollow now. At least I know. Better a grave than a question mark hanging in my mind."_

> _(He places the Heartroot on the table with care. Then looks up.)_  
> _"You did right by me. And her. Come back later, and Iâ€™ll brew you something strong. Not gold. Something _useful_."_

---

#### ðŸ§© Option 2: She Was Transformed (Possessed, Mutated, etc.)

> Quintus (after hearing the tale):**  
> _"They turned her into a _what_?"_

> _(He staggers, almost knocking over a glass jar. Then, a bitter laugh.)_  
> _"I warned her. Donâ€™t go near those old trails. Donâ€™t chase shadows. But she had the fireâ€¦ just like her mother."_

> _(He wipes his face with shaking fingers.)_  
> _"Did youâ€¦ end it? Gods, I hope you did."_

> _(If yes, he sighs and nods. If no, he looks haunted.)_

---

#### ðŸ§© Option 3: She Was Rescued

> **Quintus (as the party explains):**  
> _(His eyes widen, hands covering his mouth.)_  
> _"You brought her back? _You brought her back?_"_

> _(He slumps onto a stool, overcome.)_  
> _"Iâ€™ll never repay you. Not in this life or the next."_

> _(He grips Boâ€™s forearm with surprising strength.)_  
> _"Take whatever you need. This shop, my stores â€” they're yours. If it werenâ€™t for you, Iâ€™d be another broken man with a name on a grave."_
