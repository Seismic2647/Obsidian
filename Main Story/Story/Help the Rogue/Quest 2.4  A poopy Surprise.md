This room is dark and smells like a pet store. It's all wood chips and warm poop down here. A bunch of bats flap around the room. They look harmless.

Unless they are very stealthy and quiet the bats will be alerted and attack! They are fucking Striges!


Anyone who searches the room and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check unearths 35 sp scattered around. Searching—whether the characters find anything or not—also makes their hands smell like stirge poo, which imposes disadvantage on their Charisma checks and Charisma saving throws until it's washed off.
