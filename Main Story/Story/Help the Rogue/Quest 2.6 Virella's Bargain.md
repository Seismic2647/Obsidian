A dim lit room, The air trembles with the echoes of choirs long dead. 
You look across the room and see something like a ritual has taken place. In the middle sits a angle. The angel is all bloodied up, She looks alsmost skeletal.  Wings veined with starlight, hang limp like broken stained glass.

_A thin, lightless wind moves through the chamber as she speaks—not with her mouth, but through every blood-stained stone, every cracked fresco of Heaven above. Her voice is an aria wrapped in ruin, soft as breath, cold as the grave._

> _“I see you… Bo, whose wrath is but armor for sorrow. Aruza, still clinging to discipline like a drowning man to scripture. And Sybil, the tethered flame, promised to things she cannot name. Oh... I see you.”_

> _“You walk through this wretched world holding tight to purpose. But purpose is a blade, and you are bleeding.”_

> _(She drifts closer, feet never touching the flesh-stone beneath. Her eyes are empty, glowing wounds.)_

> _“I was once called Virelliel. Seraph of the Third Host. My song soothed the dying. My hands wove light into mercy. I helped the dead back into heaven, for them the be ressurected again so they could join us in the ethernal sin war. For doing so i now have to weep for the damned.”_

> _(She lifts a featherless wing. A single feather falls—ashen, rotting before it hits the ground.)_

> _“You seek freedom from this endless dungeon... I can offer it. But not without price. The divine never deals in gifts. Only exchanges.”



### 🩸 THE OFFERS

> _“So choose, mortals.”_  
> _“Let us barter beneath the gaze of ruined stars.”_

**🥀 Option 1: The Soul of an Innocent**

> _“Speak the name of one who is pure. One who trusts you. One who prays, perhaps, for your return.”_  
> _“Let their soul rise in your place. I will welcome them. They will become a hymn in my cathedral of silence.”_  
> _“You will never hear their name again—not in dream, nor memory. But you will live. For now.”_

**💀 Option 2: One of You**

> _(Her gaze lingers on each of them—like a parent choosing a child to die.)_  
> _“Offer yourself. One soul, surrendered willingly. Not your body, no—I have no hunger for flesh.”_  
> _“I want your truth. Your shame. Your love. I will weave it into my wings, and I will remember you, even if none other does.”_  
> _(To Bo)_ — _“Your fury will serve me well.”_  
> _(To Aruza)_ — _“Your discipline will be a golden chain in my throat.”_  
> _(To Sybil)_ — _“And you… you already belong to another. What difference does one more leash make?”_

**🔥 Option 3: Combat**

> _(If they resist… her wings unfurl. Six of them. Burned. Ruined. Glorious.)_  
> _“So you choose the sword. Fitting. It was the sword that carved my name from the Book of Grace.”_  
> _“I was _mercy_. I am _consequence_. And you… you will kneel before one or the other.”_  
> _(Her voice rises, echoing with divine thunder)_  
> _“Come, then. Let me show you what falls when angels bleed.”_
