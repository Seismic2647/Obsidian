With the treasure in hand, the chapel begins to **shudder**, and **cracks form in the ceiling** above. This is your cue to **return to the surface** — the structure may not remain stable long.

**🔔 ENCOUNTER: The Crown’s Keeper**  
_As the party emerges from the sunken chapel and begins to wade back through the murky bog, the air goes deathly still. The distant cries of the drowned forest fade. Then — a tremor. A ripple. A sudden, choking pressure in their chests… something is coming._

---

### 🌫️ Atmosphere:

- The **trees bend backward** as if recoiling from the water.
    
- **Reeds snap in a circle**, like something immense stirring just beneath the surface.
    
- The water smells **like copper and rotting lilies**.
    
- Behind the party, the half-submerged entrance to the chapel lets out a **plume of foul steam**, and a **shadow rises**…

### 🧟 Abilities:

- **Drowned Grasp (Melee, +5 to hit, 1d10+3 bludgeoning)**  
    Targets are grappled (DC 13 STR) and begin suffocating if not immune to water.
    
- **Abyssal Wave (Recharge 5–6)**  
    The Keeper slams its hands into the bog, sending a **20 ft. cone of necrotic brine** forward.
    
    - Creatures must make **DC 13 Con save**, taking 3d6 necrotic on fail, half on success.
        
    - On a fail, they also gain **1 level of exhaustion** until the end of the encounter.
        
- **Armor of the Sunken (Passive)**  
    If the Crown of Vellune is within 30 feet, the Keeper gains **+2 AC and advantage on all attacks** until the wearer takes damage from radiant or fire.
    
- **Death Wake (Triggered Ability)**  
    When reduced to 0 HP, the Keeper explodes into a geyser of **spiritual brine and bones**.
    
    - All creatures in 15 ft. radius must make a **DC 13 Dex save** or take **2d10 necrotic** and be **blinded for 1 round**.

### 🧠 Tactics:

- The Keeper fixates on **whoever wears the crown** and ignores all others unless threatened.
    
- It uses **Drowned Grasp** to drown magic users first, then unleashes **Abyssal Wave** when surrounded.
    
- The party can **weaken it** by either:
    
    - _Removing the crown from the wearer_
        
    - _Casting radiant/fire spells to break its armor_
        

---

### 🎯 Optional Actions:

1. {**Bo** tries to _yank the crown from Sybil’s head_, hurling it into the bog to draw the Keeper away.}
    
2. {**Sybil** attempts a _well-timed Eldritch Blast_, targeting a crack in the Keeper’s armor.}
    
3. {**Azura** climbs onto the beast’s back to _drive a fist into the crown-shaped hollow_ in its chest.}
    
4. {Party uses the terrain, hiding behind bog trees and _baiting the creature into a submerged sinkhole_.}
    
5. {They all _refuse to surrender_ the crown and stand back to back, fighting like hell.}

### 📜 Aftermath:

Once defeated, the Keeper collapses into a pile of **salt-crusted armor** and **black ichor**, which hardens into **glasslike bone splinters**.

Among the remains, the party finds a **half-sunken reliquary** containing:

- **1 Potion of Water Breathing**
    
- **1 Fingerbone Dagger (1d4 + 1, crits on 19–20)**
    
- A fragment of parchment etched in **Pale Speech** (undecipherable… for now)
