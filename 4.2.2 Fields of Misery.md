Excellent. With the effigy destroyed and the haunting presence cleansed, the **Dark Woods** grow quiet behind them—still eerie, still ancient, but no longer watching.

## 🩸 Journey to the **Fields of Misery**

The sun never truly rises as the party continues on. The path coils like a dying serpent into the lowlands beyond the trees. What was once forest becomes sparse, stunted brush. The air grows foul.

You enter the **Fields of Misery**.

### 🌫️ **Description**

A choking fog hangs low across a dead landscape of cracked soil and rotting vegetation. Barren trees jut out like broken bones, their branches twisted by wind and something fouler. The ground is littered with old, rusted farming tools and skeletal remains of livestock—and people. Crumbling stone walls hint at long-forgotten homesteads, now half-sunken into the black earth.

A thin trail winds forward, trodden by no feet in decades... except perhaps those that don’t belong to the living.

The scent of mildew and blood taints the air. Crows circle overhead—silent.

Time here feels **wrong**, as if dusk never leaves, and the sky itself forgets the stars.

## 🩶 Encounter: **The Mourning Plowman (Roleplay/Puzzle)**

Up ahead, the players spot a figure working the field—slow, rhythmic, dragging a rusted plow through dead earth. He doesn't look up. His body is too still. His clothes: old, peasant’s garb. His back is stitched with symbols of grief and binding.

If approached:

**PLAGUEBOUND SHADE – "The Mourning Plowman"**

> _"No crops. No harvest. Just the work... just the weight."_  
> _"She waits below the earth... and I must till her name."_

He is a **ghost**, cursed to eternally plow a name into the field until someone speaks it. At his feet, an iron tag lies buried in the dirt.

**Puzzle Clue:**  
The players may uncover the tag with a DC 13 Investigation check. It reads:

> _“Beloved J.”_

A Perception (DC 12) or Religion (DC 10) check reveals **etched script along the plow blade** in old runes: _"Only remembrance sets the soul to rest."_

### 🎯 Puzzle Solution:

If a player speaks her full name aloud—“**Josephine**”—the ghost stops. He lifts his head slowly, eyes hollow with sorrow, and smiles.

> _"Thank you... I can feel her hand again."_

His form shudders and dissolves into dust. The cursed plow rusts completely, crumbles.

## 📜 Optional Discovery (Passive Perception DC 14)

Behind a collapsed shack nearby, the party finds a **small, rotted chest** buried under hay and refuse. Inside:

- A pair of **bone dice** carved with **Runes of the Weeping God** – worth 25 gp to the right occult collector.
    
- **1 Potion of Greater Healing** sealed in black wax.
    
- A **wooden music box** that plays a soft lullaby (non-magical… or is it?)

## 🔚 Exit from the Fields

As they near the end of the cursed expanse, the path begins to slope downward. The fog thickens into a chilling mist. Broken columns rise like rotten teeth in the distance.

They approach the edge of the **Drowned Shrines**.

Would you like the Drowned Shrines to focus on **combat**, **investigation**, or perhaps a **ritual encounter**?
