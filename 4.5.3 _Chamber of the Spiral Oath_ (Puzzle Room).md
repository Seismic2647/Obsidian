Here, four **thrones of stone** are set in a circle, partially sunken. Behind each throne is an **inscribed verse**, worn with age. In the center of the room is a **flooded pool** with four pedestals and a stone lever beside it.

> "First I am honored.  
> Then I am feared.  
> Next I am obeyed.  
> In the end, I am drowned."

The thrones are labeled:

- Obedience
    
- Devotion
    
- Dread
    
- Sacrifice
    

ðŸ”Ž _Puzzle Solution_:  
The party must pull the lever, then sit in the thrones **in the correct order** to lower the water level. The correct order is:

1. Devotion (honored)
    
2. Dread (feared)
    
3. Obedience (obeyed)
    
4. Sacrifice (drowned)
    

ðŸŽ² _Insight or Religion Check (DC 11)_ gives a hint.

Success reveals a **hidden stairwell** leading deeper. Failure triggers **no trap**, but the room resets and a loud wail echoes through the walls â€” something now knows they are here.
